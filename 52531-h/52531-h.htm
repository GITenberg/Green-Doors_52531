<p>&ldquo;Hello! What&rsquo;s up with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doctor Lewis Pryne was obviously surprised at the
intrusion of a mere friend on office hours. &ldquo;How did you
persuade Miss Frazier to bring you in? You aren&rsquo;t&mdash;or
are you&mdash;looking for a doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick Wilder&rsquo;s smile was tinged with awed diffidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not wanting treatment myself,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;All the same, I did get a regulation appointment from
your secretary via the telephone, and I&rsquo;ve been out there
in your reception office meekly waiting my turn for
hours. But first I have a message for you, from Cynthia.
They want you for the week-end in Meadowbrook.
Harry&rsquo;s counting on golf with you, and the children&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis broke in dryly. &ldquo;Sorry, Dick, but I&rsquo;m most
frightfully busy just now. If you insist on staying to
chat, I&rsquo;ll send you a bill&mdash;regulation fee for a first appointment.
But if you vanish at once, I&rsquo;ll let you off.
Give my fondest love to Cynthia, tell her I&rsquo;ll call her
up; thanks, good-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But though the doctor rose, his visitor sat. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
hard, Lewis, hard,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all right
with me. I expect a bill. I&rsquo;m here to offer you a lovely
new patient on a silver platter. It is rather&mdash;ah&mdash;private,
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His embarrassment was due plainly to the presence
of the secretary, Miss Frazier. She had escorted him into
the presence of the famous psychiatrist and she was now
hovering near the door on tiptoes, it seemed, to escort
him out again.</p>
<p>Lewis sighed, but with good nature. &ldquo;Miss Frazier
needn&rsquo;t bother you,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;She is my confidential
secretary and it saves time having her here to
make a record as we go along. How many people are
out there, Miss Frazier?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only two, Doctor. Mrs. Dickerman and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sullen but gorgeous fellow who doesn&rsquo;t want to
be spoken to,&rdquo; Dick finished for her. &ldquo;Or is he one of
the really unhinged ones and not responsible for his
manners?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis smiled&mdash;fleetly&mdash;at his secretary. He said to
Dick, &ldquo;That will be Mr. Neil McCloud. He is perfectly
sane. He&rsquo;s lost the power of speech, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really? Somehow it didn&rsquo;t look all to me. He has
a flash in his eye,&mdash;well&mdash;a flash&mdash;. But I thought
the dumb were deaf, Lewis. That fellow heard every
word I said&mdash;listened as if he heard&mdash;and then coolly
turned his shoulder. He might have wriggled his eyebrows
or something, to show he couldn&rsquo;t speak. I only
asked him were you likely to keep us waiting much
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
longer&mdash;assuming, do you see, that he was a regular
patient and knew the ropes. What was there in that to
antagonize any one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis&rsquo; smile a moment ago had been very fleeting.
Now his face had taken on its accustomed gravity. It
was an unusual sort of gravity, however, lacking any
element of heaviness. &ldquo;That encounter will have been
harder on McCloud than on you, Dick,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He
isn&rsquo;t deaf. Merely can&rsquo;t articulate. Hasn&rsquo;t been able to
for some months. It&rsquo;s a rather perplexing case of shock.
Temporary, I&rsquo;m certain, but awkward for him while it
lasts. It&rsquo;s after four, I think, Miss Frazier. Did McCloud
or Mrs. Dickerman have appointments?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Doctor. Neither of them. Mrs. Dickerman telephoned
yesterday and there was no time I could give
her within a week. She came on the chance you might
be able to work her in somewhere. Mr. McCloud
dropped in in the same way. I had no idea how long
Mr. Wilder&rsquo;s appointment would take, so I rather encouraged
them both to wait. Shall I tell them there&rsquo;s no
use now? It&rsquo;s quarter to five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Don&rsquo;t do that. I&rsquo;ll see them. Only let McCloud
in ahead of Mrs. Dickerman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I? Mrs. Dickerman telephoned yesterday, as
I told you! She came in several minutes ahead of Mr.
McCloud too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she? I suppose then you&rsquo;d better convey to McCloud,
somehow, that I won&rsquo;t be long with Mrs. Dickerman.
Tell Mrs. Dickerman that I will be free in another
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
few minutes. Do that now, please, and then come
back to take this record. Pardon all this, Dick. Have a
cigarette?&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the brief exchange between doctor and secretary,
Dick had been able to form a pretty complete
mental picture of what was back of it. Mrs. Dickerman
must be some slightly neurotic lady of wealth who was
falling over herself to pay fabulous fees to Lewis for a
little mental coddling, while the rather gorgeous but
definitely shabby dark-browed young giant was, of
course, a charity case, and in real trouble. But supposing
their needs had been equal, Dick suspected his friend
still would favor the penniless down-and-outer, for Lewis
was slightly snobbish in his mistrust of wealth and position.
It was a little perverse in him. Even his own sister,
Cynthia, thought so.</p>
<p>Dick frowned to himself. This matter of Lewis&rsquo;
prejudice against paying patients was rather pertinent
to himself at the moment on account of the errand which
had brought him here. What could Petra Farwell seem
to Lewis beyond what Dick himself thought her&mdash;a
beautiful but dull ing&eacute;nue whose psychic maladjustments
(if that was the term) were the result of too
much leisure and spoiling?</p>
<p>Dick took out his cigarette case, waving Lewis&rsquo; aside,
for Lewis, he knew, was as economical when it came
to cigarette brands as he was about clothes and office
furniture. What a bare room this sanctum was! The reception
office had been on the luxurious side, but that
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
was Cynthia&rsquo;s taste and doing. She had insisted on
decorating it, and Dick could not doubt she had drawn
on her own purse for most of the accessories. But even
as he passed it up, Dick noticed that Lewis&rsquo; cigarette
case holding the Luckies or whatever they were, was
rather wonderful. Finest jade. You could see at a glance.
Marvelous color. Some grateful woman patient, of
course, had forced the gem on Lewis, and probably he
did not dream what its value was; if he did, he would
sell it, to give to the deserving poor....</p>
<p>Miss Frazier was back and ready with her shorthand
pad. Since they were smoking, Dick offered her
a cigarette, one of his own Club variety. But she refused
it, coldly, her eyes on her pad. Dick did not so
much get the idea of having been put in his place as
of the secretary having insisted on keeping hers, which
was that of an invisible, impersonal automaton&mdash;a dicta-phone
with judgment. Suddenly Dick did not mind
talking before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a stepmother stepdaughter situation,&rdquo; he explained
to Lewis. &ldquo;The stepmother is my friend. She is
a wonderful person. She knows that you and I are related
in a way. (The relationship between them consisted
in the fact that Lewis&rsquo; sister, Cynthia, was married
to Dick&rsquo;s first cousin, Harry Allen.) And she got the
idea that because of the relationship I might have some
sort of a pull with you, do you see? But perhaps that&rsquo;s
stupid. Perhaps nobody has a pull with you in that sense.
I warned her. Is it stupid?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>Lewis smiled, that peculiar fleeting smile of his. But
it was for himself this time. He had assumed the position
he kept through all these office interviews. His chair
was swung half around on its pivot so that he did not
directly face the patient, and his eyes, for the most part,
were on the knob of the door leading into Miss Frazier&rsquo;s
little private office. &ldquo;Of course you have pull, Dick, all
the pull in the world. But I don&rsquo;t see what that has to
do with it. When it comes to taking on patients, one does
it on the merits of the cases themselves, naturally. Let
me hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s the stepdaughter who is&mdash;funny. Clare,
who is my friend the stepmother, do you see, is utterly
devoted to the girl. In fact, to my mind, she is almost
obsessed with the idea that it&rsquo;s up to her to make the
girl happy. That&rsquo;s far-fetched, of course. You can&rsquo;t do
<i>that</i> for any one. But Clare tries desperately. And all
she gets for her pains is very nice polite manners and
nothing under &rsquo;em. It is absurd. You would think so&mdash;you
<i>will</i> think so&mdash;when you see Clare. But even if
Clare weren&rsquo;t so wonderful as she is, the girl&rsquo;s indifference
would still be absurd, for just on the material side
she owes Clare everything she&rsquo;s got in the world. She
and her father were as poor as poverty until Clare came
into their lives, married the father. Now that she is
there, their lives are all luxury.&mdash;Charm.&mdash;Beauty
too. But what good does it do? Clare is only getting her
heart broken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I ought to tell you,&rdquo; Dick went on quickly, after
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
a second&rsquo;s pause in which he had suddenly remembered
some last admonishments of Clare&rsquo;s, &ldquo;Clare doesn&rsquo;t mind
personal heartbreaks and things like that. That is not
why she wants you to psychoanalyze the girl. It is for
the girl&rsquo;s own sake and her father&rsquo;s sake. She doesn&rsquo;t
want those two to become estranged. And it is bound to
happen if things go on the way they are going. The girl
must be more responsive to Clare, return <i>some</i> of her
devotion, or the father is going to begin to feel the
antagonism in the air and blame his daughter for it. For,
in a choice of loyalties, the man is Clare&rsquo;s. It isn&rsquo;t Clare&rsquo;s
fault it&rsquo;s that way, though. From the very beginning she
has <i>worked</i> to preserve&mdash;even to create&mdash;a fine relationship
between her husband and his daughter. She is
big enough, detached enough, to keep herself and her
personal disappointments out of the situation and think
only of those two. And that&rsquo;s why she sent me here,
at dollars a minute, I suppose, to ask you to see the girl
and straighten her out. She has an idea that there is
some deeply hidden resentment&mdash;some mix-up, anyway&mdash;in
the girl&rsquo;s subconscious mind and that it only
needs you to excavate it. She thinks&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there Dick faltered. Lewis was smiling and no
longer fleetingly. Miss Frazier, noticing Dick look
around for it, pushed an ashtray along the desk toward
him. He crushed out his cigarette stub in it, looking
miserable and a little angry. &ldquo;I can see what you&rsquo;re
thinking, Lewis,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You think that it is a
simple case of stepdaughterish jealousy and that Clare
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
and I are just too ingenuous for words to have come
bothering a top-notch psychiatrist with it. But you happen
to be wrong. You don&rsquo;t know the people. Petra&rsquo;s
not jealous. Not for a minute. She hasn&rsquo;t enough warmth
in her for such a passion, if it comes to that. Really, she&rsquo;s
no jollier with her own father than with her stepmother.
But Clare doesn&rsquo;t see that. She thinks it&rsquo;s only herself
Petra pushes off. And what is there so absurd in her
getting the idea that you might help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if Dick had only noticed, his belated mention of
the girl&rsquo;s name had effectually changed his friend&rsquo;s expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it Petra Farwell you&rsquo;re talking about?&rdquo; he asked
quickly. &ldquo;Daughter of Lowell Farwell, the novelist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick hesitated an instant, glancing a little painfully
at Miss Frazier&rsquo;s efficient hand with its pen poised but
so far idle&mdash;above her pad. But after all, Miss
Frazier&rsquo;s presence at this conference was Lewis&rsquo; responsibility,
and one had to trust Lewis.</p>
<p>So he said, &ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s the Farwells. I thought you
would guess. You know I built their house, Green Doors.
We started it the minute they were back from the honeymoon.
Clare made Featherstone&rsquo;s give me a free hand
with it. It was my first real chance at self expression.
But Clare had as many ideas as I had and the nice part
was that our ideas didn&rsquo;t clash&mdash;merely supplemented.
Until that summer I had only known Clare socially and
even so not very well. She is in an older crowd. It&rsquo;s
an interesting crowd. The Lovings, you know,&mdash;the
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
Stracheys, Jim Strange, Isabell Peters Clough. Rather
exciting, being accepted by them! Clare sees to it that
I am. And Lowell Farwell is the lion of the lot, I suppose.
Clare herself ought to be. Wait till you meet her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have met Mrs. Farwell, once, for a few minutes,&rdquo;
Lewis said. &ldquo;She was Mrs. Tom Otis then. It was just before
the former Mrs. Farwell abdicated. But it&rsquo;s Petra,
the girl, I&rsquo;m interested to hear about. Is she prepared to
come to a psychiatrist for treatment for&mdash;what do you
say the trouble is? General lack of appropriate feeling
toward the latest Mrs. Novelist&rsquo;s Wife? Or hasn&rsquo;t she
been consulted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep on laughing at us,&rdquo; Dick complained. &ldquo;If
I were a stranger, would you? Yes, I knew about that
meeting with Clare, of course. But I meant, wait till
you <i>really</i> know her. Clare hasn&rsquo;t said a word about you
to Petra, not yet. Petra would be sure to resent it, don&rsquo;t
you think? What Clare wants is to have it come about&mdash;gradually.
If you&rsquo;re week-ending at Cynthia&rsquo;s, right
there in Meadowbrook, you can drop around at Green
Doors, meet the family, have tea informally in the
garden, chat with Petra,&mdash;and let that call seem to
put the idea of having Petra psychoanalyzed into Clare&rsquo;s
head. That way, Petra might get the idea that being
psychoanalyzed by Doctor Lewis Pryne would be a
pretty interesting experience, do you see? That&rsquo;s Clare&rsquo;s
scheme and I think it&rsquo;s a good one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis, lighting himself another cigarette, murmured,
&ldquo;Good is an adjective that I myself seldom apply to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
word &lsquo;scheme.&rsquo; But it happens that I&rsquo;ll like meeting
Lowell Farwell. His psychological novels interest me&mdash;at
least, to the point of wanting to find out how he
gets that way. Even more I shall be glad of an excuse
to see Petra again. I met her at the same time I met
your Mrs. Clare. By the way, Mrs. Clare is Petra&rsquo;s
second or third stepmother, isn&rsquo;t she! Mightn&rsquo;t it be
that the child&rsquo;s stand-offish attitude toward the species
is cumulative and not, strictly speaking, personal? Had
that occurred to either of you?... But it doesn&rsquo;t
matter. I&rsquo;m charmed by the invitation to tea at Green
Doors. It&rsquo;s only fair, though, that you should warn
Mrs. Farwell that it cannot, not possibly, be a professional
call. And just remind yourself, will you, Dick, if
only now and then, that I&rsquo;m not a psychoanalyst. It
always annoys me a little, being called one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry. Yes, I do know, of course. But the differences
are too slight for the laity to master. Then you will come
for tea? That&rsquo;s fine. All we wanted, as a start-off, really.
Clare knows you won&rsquo;t be lionized and I can promise
you it will be informal. Shall we say Saturday afternoon?
It&rsquo;ll be just the Farwells themselves and me. I&rsquo;m
there such a lot, I&rsquo;m almost family,&rdquo; he added, flushing
a little.</p>
<p>Dick was ready to get out now and give place to Mrs.
Dickerman and Mr. McCloud. But he had a diffident
feeling that since this was actually a professional seance
he had been having with Lewis, it was up to Lewis to
bring it to an end. And Lewis had not stirred in his chair.
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
He was saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll like seeing your work with that
house, too. I&rsquo;ve meant to get Cynthia to take me over,
ever since you finished it. Why do they call it Green
Doors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis&rsquo; gaze, as he spoke, was still attached to the
knob on Miss Frazier&rsquo;s door. Dick, now that he had
secured part of what Clare wanted and was no longer
anxious, was looking at his friend with an increasing
discernment in his vision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got the look of a medieval monk,&rdquo; he told
himself,&mdash;seeing it, strangely, for the first time. Well,
perhaps asceticism was the price Lewis had had to pay
for his astonishing success. He had accomplished in ten
years or so what usually takes a man in his profession
the better part of his life, if he ever achieves it at all.
&ldquo;Naturally Lewis hasn&rsquo;t had much time for the flesh-pots
along the way,&rdquo; mused Dick.</p>
<p>Doctor Lewis Pryne was only thirty-three, and yet
in the years since graduating from Harvard Medical he
had made himself a specialist in psychiatry, written three
instantly famous books on dynamic psychology, and accumulated
a clientele which might be the envy of any
other psychiatrist not congenitally superior to envy, in
the country. And he was self-made. At least, ever since
his father had died when Lewis was a Senior in Latin
High, he had earned his own way, and looked out for
Cynthia as well, until she married Dick&rsquo;s cousin, Harry
Allen. Yet here he was, in spite of that stupendous early
handicap, loaded with fame and honor&mdash;and if not with
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
money, that was simply because money did not seem to
be one of his goals.</p>
<p>Meeting Lewis in the ordinary way&mdash;that is, outside
of an office visit&mdash;you got no hint of past struggles
and their necessary austerities. His gray eyes were more
sleepy than austere, with a languid droop at the outer
corners of the heavy upper lids. His mouth curled,
slightly, as if fleeting little smiles were habitual, and
most of the time an almost palpable light played over
the lower part of the face, particularly the full but
chiseled lips. Without that light and the odd, fleeting
smile, Lewis&rsquo; mouth would have been definitely sensuous.
As it was, you never thought of that&mdash;only of its
sensitive but exquisitely impersonal sympathy.</p>
<p>The gray sleepy eyes released the door knob, came
to rest on Dick Wilder&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;How did Green Doors
come by its name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick started, realizing that this was a repeated question.
What had he been woolgathering about? Lewis,
himself. He had been busy seeing Lewis in a new, fresh
way, after a fifteen years&rsquo; friendship. That was strange.
Then he understood it. He had been seeing Lewis as
Clare would soon be seeing him,&mdash;looking at him
through Clare&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh? The name? It was Clare&rsquo;s idea. It&rsquo;s in a poem.
Published in <i>The Glebe</i>, 1914.&rdquo; (He got up as he answered.
Lewis&rsquo; time <i>was</i> precious, and staying to chatter
now would be inexcusable, after Lewis had been so altogether
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
patient and friendly.) &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember it all.
But there&rsquo;s a line&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;I know an orchard old and rare,</p>
<p class="t">I will not tell you where,</p>
<p class="t0">With green doors opening to the sun....&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Something like that anyway. Clare said we wouldn&rsquo;t
plan a house at all, but just green doors, opening to the
sun. We&rsquo;ve done it too! You&rsquo;ll see, Saturday. I&rsquo;ll pick
you up at the Allens&rsquo; around four. Crazy to show the
place to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the brief interval between Dick Wilder&rsquo;s departure
from the office and Mrs. Dickerman&rsquo;s entrance, Lewis
stood in the big window at the back of his desk, looking
down onto the glistening river of automobile tops which
was Marlboro Street, and recalled his first and only meeting
with Petra&mdash;the girl who was, so it seemed, the
one discordant note in the idyllic existence at that country
estate, already famous to literature,&mdash;Green Doors,
in Meadowbrook.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<h2 id="c2"><i>Chapter Two</i></h2><div class="img"><img src="images/ch.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="30" /></div>
<p>Lowell Farwell&rsquo;s voice making the appointment
over the telephone&mdash;it was three or four years ago
now&mdash;still vibrated through Lewis&rsquo; memory, melodious,
<i>interesting</i>. Lewis had never happened to catch
sight of the novelist at that time, nor had he since, but
he knew from numberless newspaper cuts what he looked
like. And the voice perfectly fitted those leonine, distinguished
heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife has been ill for months and now a friend
has persuaded her to see you. Her doctor agrees that it
may be a wise move to get your opinion, Doctor Pryne.
You are acquainted with him. Doctor MacKay, here in
Cambridge. He has come to the end of his resources
and is ready to give psychiatry a try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a wind-clear, blue-red-gold October afternoon,
when Lewis made that call in Cambridge. The Farwells
were living on the upper floor of an unpretentious
double house on Fayerweather Street. Instead of the
expected maid in cap and apron opening the door, there
was a girl in a brown smock.&mdash;Strange to be remembering
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
color, and shades of color, after so many months!&mdash;Her
eyes were brown-gold, and as photographically
as Lewis remembered those gay and sincere eyes, he
remembered the curves of the smiling mouth.</p>
<p>The room into which she brought Lewis was a blank
in memory. Perhaps, even at the time, it had been a
blank to his consciousness. Except for the blue gentians.
There was a clump of them growing out of dark earth
near where he laid down his hat. He supposed the
flowers must have been planted in some sort of dish,
but his memory of the Farwells&rsquo; Cambridge living room
was fringed blue gentians growing out of dark earth.</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s voice was as smiling as her mouth. &ldquo;Mrs.
Farwell will see you in a minute, Doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you Miss Farwell?&rdquo; he asked, for he knew, from
Cynthia, probably, who read the columns of literary
gossip in the Sunday papers, that Lowell Farwell had a
daughter.</p>
<p>The smile became laughter. Laughter which sounded
like pure happiness, translating itself into sound. The
rarest sort of laughter in the world. Not amusement.
Not embarrassment. Mere self-unknown joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I am Teresa Kerr. <i>This</i> is Petra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The novelist&rsquo;s daughter was sitting on the sill of an
open window, her background wall-less&mdash;a sea of blue
October air and light. She was a schoolgirl then, in a
navy blue jersey schoolgirl dress. Her attentive, innocent
eyes, set wide in a grave young brow, were the
precise color of the gentians. That repetition of color
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
and the eyes&rsquo; innocent attentiveness stabbed Lewis like
some too pure, too perfect note in music. It was the most
beautiful child&rsquo;s face&mdash;or any face&mdash;of his memory.
No wonder he remembered <i>that</i> so vividly! The short,
straight nose, the upper lip&mdash;short to the exquisite
point of breath-taking beauty&mdash;the Botticelli mouth,
the strong, white, round chin!&mdash;The child was hardly
human, she was so lovely!&mdash;Her head against the
window&rsquo;s blue background was a sculptor&rsquo;s dream. Fine,
very alive brown curls molded rather than obscured its
classic contours. The gawky schoolgirl body, in its clinging
jersey, was sculpture, too, with its wide shoulders
and long thighs....</p>
<p>Lewis had supposed, since, that the mood which took
possession of him when Teresa Kerr had opened the door
to the Farwells&rsquo; Cambridge apartment, and which had
increased like daylight upon dawn during the brief minutes
he spent with those girls waiting for Mrs. Farwell
to be ready to see him, was merely a state of <i>rapport</i>
with their youth and happiness. Their relationship with
life and with each other had by some miracle extended
itself to him and created what at the time, and in memory
ever since, had seemed a golden age circumferenced
by a passing moment.</p>
<p>When the circumference contracted upon its enclosed
eternity (these were Lewis&rsquo; similes, far-fetched, of
course, but for himself alone), it was by way of a trivial
voice calling out from the next room. Then he left timelessness,
passed through a door into a ceilinged, four-walled
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
space, and took a chair facing an emotional, pretty
woman who lay relaxed among cushions on a chaise-longue;
and at once, quite as if he had never passed
through the sound of Teresa&rsquo;s laugh and the sight of
Petra&rsquo;s attentive, innocent gaze to reach this meeting,
he gave his complete attention to Mrs. Farwell and her
woes.</p>
<p>She had these violent headaches. Weeks on end she
could not sleep and then for other weeks she slept too
much, could do nothing else but sleep. Her nerves needed
either a stimulant or a sedative, constantly. But Doctor
MacKay did not approve of drugs, not in the quantities
her case demanded. Doctor MacKay said, &ldquo;Exercise!&rdquo;
But she had this nervous heart. He admitted the nervous
heart and yet insisted on the exercise. Imagine!
Besides, how could she exercise? Riding was out of the
question. Couldn&rsquo;t afford it. And golf bored her. Terribly!
And what other exercise is there, besides golf and
riding? They hadn&rsquo;t even a car. If they had, she might
at least get some fresh air each day. But perhaps Doctor
Pryne knew for himself&mdash;she was looking at his ready-made
tweed suit&mdash;that fame did not pay in dollars and
cents. Her husband&rsquo;s novels were only for the discriminating
few. The better the review, she noticed, the
smaller the royalties always.... And noises&mdash;cooped
up in a cheap little apartment like this&mdash;noises were a
sort of crucifixion!</p>
<p>A laugh, muffled by the closed door, but audible
enough for demonstration, coincidentally bore her out.
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
Or so she imagined. She winced, becomingly, but genuinely
enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only Petra could go away to school! She is my
husband&rsquo;s daughter, you know. But we can&rsquo;t even afford
a camp for her. And big girls like that are so noisy, so
all over you! If she were a boy, she wouldn&rsquo;t be always
at home. It would be easier then. If Doctor MacKay
ever thinks I am strong enough to have a baby I do
hope it will be a boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis listened to all of this and much more with
attention. And not until Mrs. Farwell had worn herself
out with the emotion which accompanied her eager,
fluent explanations of her nervous condition, did he venture
a few tentative suggestions. But it appeared that
Doctor MacKay had made the very same suggestions
dozens of times already,&mdash;and none of them were any
good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then&mdash;?&rdquo; But it was only a mental question, a
mental shrug. Lewis was grave and interested up till the
very last. Doctor MacKay, however, had not had the
slightest excuse for calling in a psychiatrist. It was an
old story, but as disheartening and ridiculous as if it
were the first occasion on which Lewis had wasted his
time like this.</p>
<p>As it happened, the laugh which had penetrated Mrs.
Farwell&rsquo;s closed door, with its crucifying effect on one
of its hearers, was Lewis&rsquo; last touch with Teresa and
Petra. When he came out of Mrs. Farwell&rsquo;s bedroom
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
into the living room, they were gone. In their stead, a
new individual&mdash;younger than Mrs. Farwell, older
than the girls&mdash;was lying in wait for him. She had
usurped Petra&rsquo;s place in the open blue window, but she
quickly left it and came forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Mrs. Tom Otis, Doctor Pryne. A friend of the
Farwells. Mr. Farwell has commissioned me to see you
in his place. He is at a critical point in the new novel,
and if he leaves it, he&rsquo;s lost. You know how that is, since
you write yourself. He is working in my house,&mdash;has
his study there. He wants you to tell me your &lsquo;findings&rsquo;
here&mdash;if that&rsquo;s the word&mdash;and then, when he comes
to earth again, I&rsquo;m to report to him. Do you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Otis had spoken in a lowered voice in spite of
Mrs. Farwell&rsquo;s closed door, and now she found a chair
for herself with the obviously gracious intention of
permitting Lewis to do the same. She appeared so altogether
ingenuous a person that Lewis was fain to divert
his irritation over the stupidity of the situation to the
absent Lowell Farwell. Meanwhile he tried to get away
from this Mrs. Otis as promptly and tactfully as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad Mr. Farwell
didn&rsquo;t interrupt his work. There&rsquo;s no reason why he
should. Doctor MacKay will get in touch with me to-morrow
and he&rsquo;ll give Mr. Farwell my &lsquo;findings&rsquo; such
as they are, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was looking for his hat, but wondering about
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
Petra and Teresa. Why had they had to go away? He
had meant to ask them where they had found the
gentians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; Mrs. Otis moved aside, so that he saw
the dish of gentians, and then his hat beside them. &ldquo;But
please don&rsquo;t go right away. Mr. Farwell will think I
have failed him if you go without telling me what you
think about Marian. It was stupid of me, perhaps, not
to have explained myself more fully before I asked you
to tell me. You couldn&rsquo;t understand, of course. You
couldn&rsquo;t know how very close I am to these people.
Why, it was I who persuaded them to get you. I couldn&rsquo;t
bear the way things were going. Something had to be
done. Doctor MacKay is so tiresomely conservative.
Any wise, up-to-date doctor would have seen long ago
that Marian Farwell ought to go right away&mdash;to a
sanitarium&mdash;abroad&mdash;anywhere&mdash;but <i>away</i>. It isn&rsquo;t
fair to let neurotics inflict their nerves on people who
are perfectly sane and healthy. And it&rsquo;s all the worse
when an extremely sensitive artist like Lowell Farwell
is the victim! You think so too, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mrs. Otis had not waited for Lewis&rsquo; answer. She
took his agreement for granted and hurried on. &ldquo;Doctor
Pryne, see here. I am so eager&mdash;and more important,
perhaps&mdash;<i>able</i> to help. Did you think I was merely
curious and officious? That would be too hateful of me,
if it were true. But it isn&rsquo;t. This affair is almost as
much mine as it is Lowell&rsquo;s&mdash;theirs, the Farwells&rsquo;, I
mean. I got Mr. Farwell to call you in, I am paying
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
your fees, and I will send Marian abroad, anywhere,
<i>to-morrow</i>, if you will only say the word. We&mdash;Society&mdash;owe
to first-rate artists their chance for good
working conditions. Well, you and I between us can
manage things for this particular artist right now. He
won&rsquo;t let me give Marian the money for Europe as
things are, just for my urging it. But if <i>you</i> say she <i>must</i>
go&mdash; Don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Otis had seemed to Lewis at the time a rather
delightful person. A magnetic smile and an air of almost
na&iuml;ve simplicity had robbed what she said, and implied,
of too much stupidity. And she went on to speak of
her wealth with simplicity. &ldquo;What use is all this money,&rdquo;
she asked, eyes shining and wide, &ldquo;if I can&rsquo;t do some
ordinary human good with it outside of organized charity,
and without fuss? What I can&rsquo;t spend myself&mdash;spend
beautifully, I mean&mdash;certainly belongs to the next person
who needs it. And Marian, poor darling, is really
and truly my next person. It&rsquo;s as simple as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mrs. Farwell, to Lewis&rsquo; mind, was neither mentally
nor physically ill. She was a &ldquo;happiness hound,&rdquo;
nothing else in the world, and he could not honestly
prescribe Europe or a sanitarium as a cure for a deeply
rooted perversion in human character. Yet getting away
without committing himself to co&ouml;peration in Mrs.
Otis&rsquo; na&iuml;ve philanthropic schemes was difficult, the more
so since he could not, of course, tell her his &ldquo;findings.&rdquo;
But Lewis managed it at last and Dick&rsquo;s errand here
just now seemed to indicate that she had not stayed
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
permanently resentful, however she had felt at the
time.</p>
<p>And then, before anything of his call at the Cambridge
apartment had had time to fade from Lewis&rsquo; memory,
the papers were full of the divorce of Lowell and Marian
Farwell. A little while more and two marriages were
front-page news, Lowell Farwell to Mrs. Clare Otis <i>n&eacute;e</i>
Fay, and Mrs. Marian Farwell, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dodge to&mdash;somebody
or other. The name hardly mattered since it was
merely her recent connection with the celebrated novelist
which gave the happiness hound&rsquo;s new marriage its
ephemeral public interest. And now, less than three years
after that so simple solution of their problems&mdash;and a
wonder Mrs. Clare had not hit on it sooner and had
ever bothered to try plotting with a psychiatrist!&mdash;she
had Lewis again marked down as a fellow conspirator.</p>
<p>What did she want to buy from him this time, Lewis
asked himself. Her stepdaughter&rsquo;s affection, according to
Dick. But that would be only part of it. With three years
for perspective, Lewis was more than a little doubtful
of &ldquo;Clare&rsquo;s&rdquo; simplicity. But he could not guess what she
might be wanting. It would be interesting to see, possibly.
And in any case, there would be Petra. And Teresa
Kerr. Who was Teresa Kerr, anyway, and where was she
now, Lewis wondered. Well, Petra could tell him that.
He would ask her on Saturday, the first thing.</p>
<p>To-day was only Wednesday. Three days, then, to
go until he should see Petra. It seemed an unconscionably
long time to wait. But why, then, had he let three years
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
go past without inquiring from Cynthia, or the dozen
other people who could certainly have told him, what
had become of Petra since Farwell&rsquo;s last marriage, and
who was Teresa Kerr?</p>
<p>He turned sharply around, as if startled away from
the window by astonishment at himself for this strangely
belated impatience.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<h2 id="c3"><i>Chapter Three</i></h2><div class="img"><img src="images/ch.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="30" /></div>
<p>Green Doors lay a few miles beyond Meadowbrook,
well away from the main highway on a meandering
country road of its own. The new house had been built
on the site of the old farmhouse which it had replaced,
with its front door only a few paces from the road. In
a general way the new house followed the contours of
the old. The long, low lines of the sheds and the high,
gabled lines of the barn&mdash;all house now&mdash;gave the
place, as one came on it, a casual air of simplicity. It
melted into the landscape as if it were painted on it.
The white walls, shadowed by old, gnarled apple trees,
were friendly with the dusty white country road, while
the entire landscape of meadows and fields, with stretches
of brook-cooled woodland, cradled the new dwelling as
no changeling but its own child, in a peaceful lap. So
Lewis at any rate felt as he arrived with Dick, in Dick&rsquo;s
car, at tea time on that Saturday afternoon which had
come, at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Clare&rsquo;s guest house,&rdquo; Dick explained of a
small one-story doll-house-like place directly across the
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
way from the big house. &ldquo;It used to be the cow sheds.
We found it amusing, having the estate cut in two by
the public road, and we have used the road in our landscaping&mdash;up
to the hilt. Autos almost never come this
way, and the hay carts and occasional cows that do only
add to the flavor. Isn&rsquo;t it jolly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very!&rdquo; Lewis agreed. &ldquo;And infinitely peaceful. Does
Farwell write here at Green Doors?&rdquo; He was contrasting
the novelist&rsquo;s Cambridge home with this latest one
and thinking that Clare appeared, at least on the surface,
to have been successful in giving this particular
artist an ideal environment for his creative ventures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. But in a little studio off in the woods. He
made us build it according to his own ideas and Farwell&rsquo;s
genius doesn&rsquo;t work along the lines of architecture. But
such as it is, it&rsquo;s his own, and that&rsquo;s charm enough, I
suppose. We&rsquo;ve laughed over it quite a lot, Clare and I,
but it&rsquo;s well out of sight and it doesn&rsquo;t matter what it
looks like so very much, just so long as it serves its
purpose. And it does that. The man practically lives
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis could not help thinking of his own books written
in snatched minutes at his office, on trains, in hotel bedrooms
in the dead of night with the call to sleep like
a fire-engine siren shrieking a warning in his brain. But
Farwell&rsquo;s was creative writing and that was a different
sort altogether, necessitating leisure and solitude, at any
price&mdash;possibly! But there Lewis pulled himself up.
&ldquo;Lord! This matter of price is none of my business!
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
They may be quite decent people at heart, really, and
even happy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The front door had its step&mdash;a big, flat slate stone&mdash;a
little below the level of the road. The hall into
which one entered after so unpretentious an approach
was almost startling in its palatial proportions. It was
the height of the old barn, and the floor and the walls&mdash;with
a balcony running around the second story on
three sides&mdash;were made of composition which gave the
effect of stone. In its own right, this great hall was a
work of art; but on such a day as this, with the whole
farther end opened to the New England countryside,
it became merely a neutral frame for the garden, which,
a mass of passionate color, cut a flaming swathe through
a wooded valley to orchard-draped hills beyond.</p>
<p>The maid who had opened the door for them said,
&ldquo;Mrs. Farwell would like you to go through into the
garden. She is under the elm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The terrace, as they came to it, was merely an unroofed
continuation of the floor of the great hall. It
ended with wide slabs of flower-rimmed stone shelving
down into grassy sweeps of hot June color. Off at one
side, in a distant corner of the lawn, some Chinese garden
chairs were grouped around a rustic table in the shade
of a perfect wineglass elm. A little beyond, in the same
shade, a woman in a white dress lay stretched in a long
chair, her back to the house. A big garden hat, brilliant
orange, was tossed on the grass beside her.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Farwell was not asleep, for she heard their
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
voices, and jumping up, came several steps out beyond
the shade in her eagerness to welcome them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Petra and I were to play tennis. She was to have
joined me here&mdash;oh&mdash;ages ago&mdash;and she hasn&rsquo;t, and
I&rsquo;ve just stayed on waiting all afternoon, and never
dreamed it was tea time. Look at me!&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Farwell
meant apology for her crumpled, sleeveless frock, for
her ankle socks on suntanned bare legs, for rather shabby
sneakers. &ldquo;I meant to change, of course. But the afternoon
is a dream and I have been dreaming with it, since
Petra never came. The child must not forget her tea
date, though, and I don&rsquo;t think she will. She remembered
you perfectly, Doctor Pryne, and seemed actually <i>pleased</i>
that you were coming.&mdash;Yes, Richard! Petra <i>showed
pleasure</i>. Doesn&rsquo;t that sound propitious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood for another minute out in the glare where
she had met her guests, looking hopefully toward the
house, as if half expecting Petra&rsquo;s arrival to coincide
with theirs. &ldquo;Lowell too!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;My husband
was terribly pleased you were coming, Doctor
Pryne. But time doesn&rsquo;t exist for him when he is working.
He will be sure to turn up, though. He has no
intention of missing you&mdash;this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she shaded her brow with her palm and, turning
suddenly to Dick, smiled deliberately and sweetly
into his eyes. Lewis wished he had been looking somewhere
else when this happened. She led them back to
the chairs and herself took the one nearest the tea table.</p>
<p>His hostess was not nearly so pretty as Lewis remembered
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
her. But she was much more than pretty! Yes&mdash;sitting
upright against the fantastic high back of the
Chinese chair, in her sleeveless white frock, her hair
black as the lacquer of the wickerwork, her very long,
curving lashes black, tipped in gold, and dimples subtly
hinted in her thin cheeks&mdash;she was vital and engaging.</p>
<p>But specious!&mdash;Lewis quickly added. Before, when
he had thought her rather beautiful and certainly na&iuml;vely
ingenuous, he had been looking at her through the beginning
of twilight in a city apartment. But this second
time her background was an elm and the light was of
broad day. That changed things somewhat. Lewis did not
particularly enjoy his present skepticism. But he could
not help himself. And his next unhallowed thought was
&ldquo;Poor Dick!&rdquo; For the latest Mrs. Farwell&rsquo;s particular
variety of predatoriness was of the sort that relishes a
spiritual flavor to its meat; so Lewis, at any rate,
hazarded. The bodies, even the hearts of men, would not
be enough: Clare Farwell would demand the soul before
all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty selfish of Petra to waste your afternoon for
you like this!&rdquo; Dick exclaimed. He turned to Lewis.
&ldquo;You can see for yourself how it is. You&rsquo;ve run right
onto it, first thing, without our showing you. It&rsquo;s always
like this. This is the way Petra treats Clare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Richard! Please! How horrid that sounds. It&rsquo;s
a little unjust as well. This time I am almost certain she
really and genuinely forgot I was waiting for her. Her
offering to play with me at all was generous. Petra is a
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
hum-dinger at tennis, Doctor Pryne, and I am only fairish.
So it&rsquo;s not much fun for her, playing with me. This
is probably the truth of it: Petra wanted to be nice, then
her subconscious mind got busy making her forget and
so saved her from having to be nice. Doctor Pryne will
tell you, Richard, that the hardest things not to forget
are the duties which bore us.&rdquo; She was laughing but in
spite of that she meant them to believe her serious.</p>
<p>Clare <i>would</i> call Dick &ldquo;Richard.&rdquo; Given her type, it
was almost inevitable. Lewis wondered why it had taken
him so unaware and why it need so irritate him. And it
was also inevitable&mdash;but for this he had been totally
unprepared&mdash;that she would overtly exonerate the
slandered Petra and in the very act make it look worse
for the child. For she was a person who could have her
cake and eat it too, every time. It was a trick act, peculiar
to the type.... But Lewis liked his own critical
self less and less in exact ratio as he found himself liking
Petra&rsquo;s stepmother less and less. He wished he had
never had to see her by daylight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Subconscious mind nothing!&rdquo; Dick scoffed. &ldquo;Clare,
you&rsquo;re always making excuses for everybody, but most of
all for Petra. Couldn&rsquo;t she <i>see</i> you waiting out here all
afternoon from every window in the house? Wouldn&rsquo;t
that circumvent her subconscious forgettery mechanisms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, if she were in the house, my dear Richard.
But she may have gone for a walk. Now, though, she&rsquo;ll
be back, dressing for this party of ours. <i>I</i> should have!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I only wish I had known you were just waiting
around here for nothing!&rdquo; Dick was thoroughly upset.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been spoiling for exercise all afternoon. Cynthia
insisted it was too hot to play, Harry stuck at his
bank, and Lewis couldn&rsquo;t be torn from Marlboro Street
one minute ahead of time. But I&rsquo;m sleeping at the Allens&rsquo;
to-night, after Petra&rsquo;s dance. How about a game tomorrow
morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my dear boy, to-morrow is Sunday,&rdquo; Clare reminded
him. Then, to Lewis, she explained, almost with
a blush, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be shocked, Doctor Pryne. I never impose
my religious idiosyncrasies on others, not even on
my family. One doesn&rsquo;t! And I don&rsquo;t even carry my
peculiarity to the point of going to church&mdash;do I,
Richard? Oh, yes, I do really, only not&rdquo;&mdash;she laughed&mdash;&ldquo;the
Meadowbrook Congregational Church! Green
Doors is my church.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I know an orchard, old and rare,</p>
<p class="t">I will not tell you where,</p>
<p class="t0">With green doors opening to the sun,</p>
<p class="t">And the sky children gather there&mdash;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can slip away, with a volume of essays or poetry,
stretch out anywhere in the grass and sun on one of those
slopes up there, and feel God nearer than He would
ever come to me in the four walls of any church on
earth, even the most beautiful cathedral. My husband
says that that&rsquo;s pagan. Perhaps it is. I am pagan, I think.
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
But words for one&rsquo;s religion don&rsquo;t matter, do they! <i>I
know what I know, and I feel what I feel, and it is&mdash;beautiful.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, laughing again, she asked, &ldquo;What church do
you go to, on Sundays, Doctor Pryne? Not one built by
men, any more than I, I&rsquo;m sure. You too are beyond
that kindergarten point in evolution. You see, I know
you much better than you can even begin to know me,
for I have read your books!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Good Lord! What had Lewis&rsquo; books to say of his religion?
They were austerely psychological, made up of
the findings and the theories of a practising psychiatrist.
The philosophical humility in all his writing was Lewis&rsquo;
pride. But he was saved the trouble of defending his
pride just then, even if he had thought it worth the
trouble, for Clare&rsquo;s stepdaughter, Petra, had come down
the terrace steps and was hurrying across the lawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imagine Clare calling herself the mother of that!&rdquo;
Dick laughed&mdash;and Lewis, somehow, knew that the
remark and its accompanying mirth was probably as
familiar at this tea table as was Clare&rsquo;s explanation of
her individualistic out-of-doors worship.</p>
<p>Clare murmured hurriedly, softly&mdash;her fingers just
touching Lewis&rsquo; coat sleeve as she leaned toward him&mdash;&ldquo;Richard
is only teasing me. He knows perfectly well
that I&rsquo;m not flattered. I am thirty years old and have
no ambition to compete with Petra&rsquo;s <i>lovely youth</i>. What
I long to be is a mother to her, a real one. How I long
for it! But I need your help, Doctor Pryne. You will
see how I need it....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>Petra, when she reached the shade of the elm, was
constrained and even a little awkward. But that was
hardly surprising. All three of them had watched her
approach from the instant that she had come down the
terrace steps, and she might very well have felt that
Clare&rsquo;s murmurings in Lewis&rsquo; ear, and even more, Dick&rsquo;s
laugh, concerned herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darling!&rdquo; Clare exclaimed, smiling up at her through
her really fascinating lashes. &ldquo;What a perfectly enchanting
frock! It&rsquo;s new! And you never showed it to me!
And look at me! I haven&rsquo;t even changed!&mdash;This is my
daughter, grown up, since you saw her, Doctor Pryne.
Sit down quickly, darling. It&rsquo;s too hot to keep the men
standing. And here&rsquo;s the tea. Draw your chairs to the
table.&mdash;You needn&rsquo;t stay to pass things, Elise.&rdquo; She
threw a warm, grateful smile to the maid who had
brought out the tray. The look she won in return was
humbly idolizing.</p>
<p>Lewis held a chair out for Petra, and when she took
it, drew his own along beside it.</p>
<p>The gawky schoolgirl body had rounded into selfconscious
maturity. Otherwise Petra was exactly the
girl of Lewis&rsquo;, in this case strangely explicit, memory
... until she turned from him and the intense gentian
blue of her eyes no longer blurred his power for deeper
perception. Then he saw that the attentive fairy-tale
gaze was quite gone; or if there was attentiveness there
now, it was not bent on a happy, mystery-brimmed world
before the girl&rsquo;s face, but on a realm within. Childlike
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
receptiveness was transformed to a look of reserve made
vivid. The utter beauty of the remembered child face
was there&mdash;intact&mdash;but it no longer took one&rsquo;s breath;
it was protected by this vivid reserve as by a sword, on
guard.</p>
<p>But Lewis was not sorry for the sword. He saw that
it would, at any rate, keep her safe from Clare. He knew
that Youth often has need of its seeming hardness until
years give it some chance to acquire a little subtlety in
its denials, if it is to protect with any success the inner,
personal development of its own integrity.</p>
<p>Lewis took the teacup and saucer Clare handed him.
He helped himself to toast and strawberry jam. He
laughed, amusedly, at some remark or other of
&ldquo;Richard&rsquo;s,&rdquo; and could even have repeated the witticism
word for word if it had been required of him. But in
spite of all this overt conformity to the social requirements
of those first minutes since Petra&rsquo;s arrival under
the elm and his holding her chair for her, he was conscious
of one thing only, the young girl&rsquo;s living, breathing,
<i>still</i> self, there at his side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<h2 id="c4"><i>Chapter Four</i></h2><div class="img"><img src="images/ch.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="30" /></div>
<p>It was Dick who brought up the broken tennis
date, not Clare. Petra came out of her stillness to show
a mild surprise. &ldquo;But I thought it wasn&rsquo;t definite,&rdquo; she
turned to Clare. &ldquo;I thought we were to play if we felt
like it when the time came. And then it was so hot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The breath of silence which Clare allowed to follow
this and the expression which crossed her face spoke an
acute surprise on her part; but it was quickly followed by
a seeming desire to shield Petra from anybody&rsquo;s criticism,
even her own. Tactfully she changed the subject
to ask, &ldquo;What did you do all afternoon, darling? It
has been deliciously hot.&rdquo; And then to Lewis, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m like
Shelley. I adore hot summer days and am more alive
then than ever.&rdquo;&mdash;But she repeated her question to
Petra: &ldquo;What did you do with yourself all afternoon,
darling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petra answered, after a momentary hesitation, as if
she needed the pause in which to choose between several
possible replies, &ldquo;After lunch I took a book and went
off in the woods, where it was cool&mdash;and read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was nice. What book, darling?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Marius, the Epicurean.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really! It&rsquo;s years since I&rsquo;ve even looked into it. I
should love to read some of &lsquo;Marius&rsquo; with you, sometime,
Petra. Why don&rsquo;t we? I&rsquo;ll take it to bed with me
to-night, skim through as far as you have gone to refresh
my memory, and then, to-morrow, we will go on
with it together. Petra, yes! You come to my church
with me to-morrow morning, early, and we&rsquo;ll read
&lsquo;Marius.&rsquo; Where did you leave the book?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wild color flaming in Petra&rsquo;s cheeks took Lewis by
surprise. Again that hesitation before answering her stepmother&rsquo;s
simple question. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I left it in the
woods&mdash;somewhere. I&rsquo;ll find it before people begin
coming to-night. I might go and look now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. Not now. Of course not. At least, it depends
on what copy you took. Was it your father&rsquo;s specially
bound copy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling! You must know what your book looked
like! If it was my Modern Library edition, of course it
doesn&rsquo;t matter a bit,&mdash;though it has my notes in it!
Where did you find the one you used? In the library
or my sitting room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petra&rsquo;s eyes met Lewis&rsquo;. She found his look completely,
absorbedly hers. She took a grip on that absorption,
steadied herself by it, and answered Clare.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember where I found it, but it hasn&rsquo;t your
notes. It&rsquo;s not your copy. And it&rsquo;s not Father&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s my
own.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;But it must be your father&rsquo;s or mine. There are only
those two copies of Pater in the house. I don&rsquo;t see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But suddenly Clare did appear to see and broke off.
Indeed, an expression of seeing all too well had passed
wavelike over her quicksilver face. She turned to Lewis
as if to distract attention from what she had suddenly
seen, and perhaps, too, from Petra&rsquo;s hot cheeks, and
asked him whether he had read her husband&rsquo;s latest
novel. He had and began talking about it. But he wanted
to take Petra&rsquo;s hand, where it lay on her chair arm, and
close his down on it with strength. He did not care
about what he surmised was a mere silly schoolgirl fib.
If she wanted to impress Clare and Dick&mdash;even himself&mdash;with
the seriousness of her reading, what of it!
At least, she did not lie subtly, through the medium of
fleeting quicksilver changes of facial expression. Hardly.
The cheek he barely allowed himself to see was one
flame&mdash;as if an angel had lied.</p>
<p>Tea and a protracted discussion of Lowell Farwell&rsquo;s
novels came to an end in time, and Lewis at last could
turn to Petra with: &ldquo;I want to hear something about
Teresa. Or must I say Miss Kerr?&mdash;But I&rsquo;m not going
to &lsquo;Miss&rsquo; you, Petra, if you don&rsquo;t mind. Until to-day I
have never thought of one of you girls without the other.
Shall I meet her too, again? I hope so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But something was wrong, terribly wrong. This,
surely, was not a question Petra would need to make up
an answer for! But she was not even trying to make up
an answer. She was looking, almost wildly, toward Clare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Clare laughed. &ldquo;Why, Petra! You never told me you
and Doctor Pryne had mutual friends! Teresa&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Teresa Kerr.&rdquo; Lewis spoke shortly, dryly, because
of his complete astonishment at Petra&rsquo;s ill-concealed
panic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Clare remembered. Suddenly, it seemed. &ldquo;That
must have been the maid. Petra, I wonder what has become
of Teresa? You were David and Jonathan once,
you two. You were a funny child, my dear, when I first
knew you in Cambridge&mdash;and so beautifully democratic!
But I&rsquo;m afraid we can&rsquo;t tell you anything about
the girl, Doctor Pryne. The whereabouts of vanished domestics
is as much a problem as that of all safety pins.
Richard! Do you remember Felix Fairfax, our inimitable
butler! I wonder what has become of him! My husband
made me get rid of him, Doctor Pryne, because
he helped himself to one of my photographs and had it
in his room. I wrote him a recommendation that was a
marvel, though. Anybody who couldn&rsquo;t read between
the lines deserved what they got....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petra, who until this moment had tasted nothing, now
took up her cold cup of tea and drank thirstily, while
Dick and Clare became mildly hilarious over a growing
volume of anecdotes concerning the inimitable Felix
Fairfax, the flirtatious, vanished and banished butler,
whom Lewis&rsquo; question about Teresa had brought to mind.</p>
<p>Lewis was silent. He was not looking at Petra, but
he knew instinctively when she lost her strange, inexplicable
fear, and relaxed. A baby, with a pretty young
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
nurse in its wake, was running down the lawn, toward
the tea table. Petra had been the first to notice the invasion
and welcomed the diversion it brought. Then
Clare, following Petra&rsquo;s eyes, saw the baby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Sophia!&rdquo; she cried, quickly on her feet, while
anecdotes of Felix Fairfax hung broken off in mid-air.
She ran forward a few steps and knelt on the grass, her
arms spread wide to receive her little daughter. In that
gracious moment Clare was like nothing in the world but
a dancing Greek figure on some lovely old vase&mdash;all
quicksilver, grace and charm. Dick&rsquo;s face glowed appreciatively.
Even Lewis, for that minute, was aware of
Clare&rsquo;s loveliness.</p>
<p>The baby, however, made a swooping detour to avoid
the wide-flung, slender arms of the kneeling mother and
plunged straight for Petra, her big half-sister. Petra
held her off, at arm&rsquo;s length. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been in the brook.
You&rsquo;re dirty. You&rsquo;re muddy. Don&rsquo;t touch my dress. No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rebuffed cherub commenced to wail but Petra
did not relent and draw her into her arms. &ldquo;No! No!&rdquo;
She repeated it. &ldquo;Mustn&rsquo;t spoil Petra&rsquo;s beautiful, clean
dress. No. <i>I&rsquo;m not going to pick you up.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Clare swept down upon them and snatched the
baby up. Two muddy palms immediately made their
mark on the shoulders of her white frock. But she lifted
the delicious little hands and kissed them, one after the
other, gravely&mdash;delicately. Her eyes, over the baby&rsquo;s
golden head, looked at Petra now with healthy, open
accusation, and she held the delicious little body more
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
and more tightly to her, while small wet shoes muddied
her skirt.</p>
<p>Clare, looking away from Petra at last, met Doctor
Pryne&rsquo;s puzzled eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take little Sophia up
to the nursery, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me for only a few minutes,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Anyway, I wanted you to see our guest
house&mdash;the view at its back. You get the river there.
Petra will show you. And this is a good time&mdash;before
Lowell comes along.&mdash;Richard, you may come up with
us and see what a nice supper a nice cook has sent up to
a nice nursery for an adorable baby! Only first we&rsquo;ll
help a nice nurse to wash these precious, dirty paws....
No, Richard, I want to carry her myself. Truly. You
don&rsquo;t mind, Doctor? I always run up to the nursery at
little Sophia&rsquo;s supper time, even in the middle of quite
formal parties. But it only takes a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes, on Lewis&rsquo;, were replete with meaning. &ldquo;Now
is your time,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;Do make a beginning at helping
me understand this strange girl. You can&rsquo;t deny she
is lacking in normal responses. Help me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by, sister,&rdquo; Petra murmured, and went near
enough to lay her cheek for just a breath against her
little sister&rsquo;s hair. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t let you spoil my pretty
dress, honey. But I do love you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this belated gesture, Clare&rsquo;s beseeching look at
Lewis transformed itself to one of ironic amusement.</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;If you are really interested in the view, Doctor
Pryne, it&rsquo;s across the road. We can go through the kitchen
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
garden. That is shorter than going back through the
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The kitchen garden, through which Petra led him,
was a jungle of drooping, white-starred blackberry canes.
They came out of it through a little wicket gate and
crossed the intimate, idle road to the guest house opposite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clare won&rsquo;t let them cut the grass here,&rdquo; Petra explained.
&ldquo;Any objection to wading?&rdquo; Lewis had none
and followed the girl around the side of the little house
and came to an uncovered piazza at the back. Ignoring
the several chairs arranged with an eye to the view there,
they sat down side by side on the edge of the piazza
boards. From under their feet wide sweeps of June fields
surged away in many-colored rippling waves. White and
yellow daisies, red and white clovers, golden buttercups,
orange devil&rsquo;s-paintbrush, and sparkling sun-soaked grass
dazzled Lewis&rsquo; eyes against the view of river and blue
hills beyond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paradise will be a June field like this,&rdquo; he thought,
&ldquo;with the saints reunioning while the angels dance.&rdquo; He
was thinking of Fra Angelico&rsquo;s &ldquo;Last Judgment,&rdquo; the
detail of the left corner.&mdash;&ldquo;Petra and I seem to have
arrived somewhat ahead of time, though,&mdash;and, God
knows, without our crowns! This girl! She is a breaker
of promises, a vain poser, a liar, a traitor to friendship,
and a repulser of innocent babyhood. Clare made her
do her paces. Just didn&rsquo;t she, though!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But his next thought was more like shock than thought.
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
&ldquo;Why need her hands be as lovely as her face? Or <i>is</i>
this Paradise!&rdquo; They were clasped about her knees,
strong, sun-tanned hands, with long, squarish-tipped
fingers. Angelic hands!</p>
<p>Lewis remarked, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petra agreed, &ldquo;Yes, isn&rsquo;t it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis lighted a cigarette and Petra pulled a grass
blade to make a bracelet, bending forward from lithe
hips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought I was horrid to my baby sister, didn&rsquo;t
you, Doctor Pryne?&rdquo; she asked bluntly. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t, not
really. But I couldn&rsquo;t let her spoil my dress, could I?
This is the first time I&rsquo;ve worn it. It would have to be
dry-cleaned if I had picked her up. And things are never
so nice again after they are dry-cleaned. Besides, I can&rsquo;t
afford it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dress she had so ruthlessly protected against a
bewitching baby was smooth silk, the color of heavy
cream. Its only decoration was a flight of embroidered
gold and brown bees. They flew up one full sleeve from
wristband to shoulder, across the back of the neck and
down the other body-side of the frock to the lower edge
of the hem. It was&mdash;taken by itself&mdash;a lovely frock,
and if it had not been so utterly Petra&rsquo;s own, belonged
so completely to her shapely young body and coloring,
even Lewis&mdash;no connoisseur in women&rsquo;s clothes&mdash;would
have noticed its lovely detail before this.</p>
<p>Petra dropped her grass bracelet&mdash;half made&mdash;into
the grass and picked up the hem of her skirt, folding it
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
back. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how beautifully finished it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The flight of bees had been carried on, in all its careful
perfection, to the upper edge of the hem on its inner
side, where it would never show. It was as if the embroiderer
had loved her work too well to realize when
she had done enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clare&rsquo;s dress was nothing at all,&rdquo; Petra was saying.
&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t matter what little Sophia did to it. Besides, if
Clare ruined a dozen dresses, it wouldn&rsquo;t matter. She
could buy dozens more.... So it wasn&rsquo;t fair, was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. It was hardly fair,&rdquo; Lewis agreed absently.</p>
<p>Petra jumped up. The bee-embroidered hem of her
skirt brushed through the flowers in the deep grass. She
came closer to Lewis, stood there before him in the long
grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you spare me a cigarette?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>She had not smoked at the tea table and Lewis had
taken it for granted she was that rare thing, a modern
girl who did not smoke. Apologetically, he offered her
his opened cigarette case and struck a match for her on
the piazza boards. (The grateful patient should have
given Lewis a lighter along with the case!) But he
might as well have kissed her as have held the light for
her,&mdash;with his face like that. Even before the girl saw
Lewis&rsquo; face, she felt what was there for her to see. Her
eyelids swept up, to verify her suddenly alert instinct,
and for just that instant blue reticence, under Lewis&rsquo; own
startled eyes, leapt into blue flame.... Petra drew a
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
little away, trying to smile and utterly failing. Lewis
lighted a fresh cigarette for himself.</p>
<p>Petra puffed at hers for a minute only and then it
went the way the bracelet had gone, only she bent to
press out the spark&mdash;firmly, securely&mdash;into damp grass
roots. Returning to her place, she clasped her hands
around her knees again and explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really I don&rsquo;t know how to smoke, not gracefully.
You shouldn&rsquo;t have watched me! You made me feel
hypocritical, watching me like that. But I do smoke,
sometimes. Almost every night. One or two cigarettes
after dinner with Father. So I wasn&rsquo;t pretending, you
see....&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went on, after a minute, &ldquo;You asked me about
Teresa, remember? I&rsquo;ll tell you now. I couldn&rsquo;t say a
word with Clare listening. But Clare lied about her. She
knows perfectly well that Teresa wasn&rsquo;t our maid&mdash;not
in the sense that that Fairfax person was Clare&rsquo;s butler,
I mean. Teresa was nothing in the world but our
guardian angel,&mdash;father&rsquo;s, Marian&rsquo;s, and mine. And she
is my best friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis said coolly, &ldquo;Yes, of course! I knew that. I
saw that it was so, that afternoon in Cambridge. And
when Mrs. Farwell said that Teresa was gone out of
your life like a lost safety pin I knew it couldn&rsquo;t be true.
But <i>why</i> did she say it? And why did you let her say it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Clare wasn&rsquo;t lying when she said that. She
thought, I mean, that it was true enough. It was in saying
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
Teresa was our maid, putting her with Felix Fairfax,&mdash;that
was the lie. But so far as Clare knows, Teresa
is gone&mdash;just as absolutely as any disappearing safety
pin. I wish I were as elusive,&mdash;that Clare had mislaid
me too. But she has a use for me. She thinks she has, anyway,
and she actually pays me a wage of two thousand
dollars a year to live here at Green Doors and be a
model stepdaughter.&rdquo;&mdash;Petra flashed a defiant look at
Lewis and added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m different from Clare&rsquo;s other servants,
you see. I don&rsquo;t adore her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s hands, Lewis noticed, were no longer clasping
her knees. They were gripping them. But he gave
no sign that he was conscious of her anger and her
rebellion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you just listen to that bird,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Bobolinks
are usually cheerful, of course. But this fellow is
carrying it beyond reason, it seems to me! He might
have a peephole into heaven,&mdash;the way he sounds.&rdquo;
For a bobolink, apparently beside himself with rapture,
was circling and swooping, swooping and circling, singing
his jetty little throat to bursting. His nest must be
hidden somewhere in the grass not a dozen yards from
where they sat on the piazza&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<p>Petra tilted her head to see the speck of song against
the sunlight. She stayed silent until the rapture ended
and the heaven-glimpser sank home. She even waited a
minute or two beyond that sudden silence before
she said, but calmly now, her twined fingers relaxing
their grip, &ldquo;My friend, Teresa, is like that bobolink&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
song. At least, she&rsquo;s as happy as that. Jolly as that. I&rsquo;ll tell
you about her, Doctor Pryne. I am glad that you think
of us together. I adore her, of course. She was born in
Edinburgh, Scotland, and she lived there till she was
fifteen. Her father and mother kept a day school for
boys. But Teresa had four sisters and they all went to
the boys&rsquo; school. There were three brothers. Eight children
in Teresa&rsquo;s family, you see....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<h2 id="c5"><i>Chapter Five</i></h2><div class="img"><img src="images/ch.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="30" /></div>
<p>Lewis listened, without looking at Petra. As she
told him about Teresa, they were both watching for another
flight of the bobolink, their eyes focused on the
delicately waving tide of grass above the hidden nest.
Hearing Petra&rsquo;s voice, this way, without looking at her,
Lewis learned as much about her as she was telling him
about Teresa; for her voice had none of the reticence of
her gentian eyes nor the stubborn power of her rounded
chin. It was a gentle voice, clipped and ingenuous. Above
all ingenuous. What her face had lost with childhood
her voice had strangely taken on. It had a listening, attentive
quality. Lewis, in the practice of his profession,
had gradually acquired a habit of separating voices from
their possessors. He had discovered that while the face
and the very pose and carriage of a person may deceive,
the human voice simply cannot. It is the materialization
of personality into sound waves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;... Eight children. Teresa&rsquo;s mother had taught the
fifth grade in a public school in Cambridge. Teresa&rsquo;s
father was Scotch. They met when Mr. Kerr was over
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
here working for a doctor&rsquo;s degree at Harvard. He came
from Edinburgh. They fell so much in love that they
couldn&rsquo;t wait for the degree but got married and went
to Edinburgh and started the day school. But it didn&rsquo;t
pay except just in the beginning. By the time all eight
children were there in the Kerr family, they began to be
really poor. The Kerr children themselves were half the
school, you see. Teresa was the oldest. When Teresa
was fifteen, they gave up the school in Edinburgh and
returned to Cambridge. Teresa&rsquo;s father got all the tutoring
he could do. He was a magnificent teacher. They
lived in a five-room apartment on Lawrence Street, all
crowded in, but soon they moved to Boston and had a
bigger place, in the top floor of a tenement on Bates
Street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teresa&rsquo;s mother and father taught the children as
they had done in Scotland. Only her mother did most
of it, of course, because her father was away tutoring
all day. But the Kerrs had their own ideas about education
and didn&rsquo;t want the children to go to public school.
They wanted them to learn Greek and Latin, you see,
almost in their cradles. But Teresa did go to High
School. She was fifteen when they came to America and
her father let her go into the Senior Class in the High
School just so she could get a diploma that June. After
school she helped with the housework and helped with
the children&rsquo;s lessons too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That January two of Teresa&rsquo;s sisters died, the two
who came next her in age. They had T&nbsp;B anyway, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
doctor said, but they actually died of pneumonia. Very
suddenly. They had been Teresa&rsquo;s playmates. The rest
of the children were more like her babies, she took so
much care of them. But Teresa stayed out of school only
one week when they died. She needed her diploma, you
see, because she was going to go on through college and
become a teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;... Well, but when spring came ... something
terrible happened.... It is too terrible to tell. But if
Teresa bore it, I guess you can bear hearing it, Doctor
Pryne. Shall I tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Lewis urged. &ldquo;I want to hear,&rdquo; but added with
quick compunction, &ldquo;if it doesn&rsquo;t hurt you too much,
Petra,&rdquo;&mdash;and was utterly astonished by the devastating
look Petra gave him. But her scorn was for herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurt me too much!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I only wish
it could hurt me! Really hurt me! It is too terrible that
one person had to bear it all alone. And Teresa, of all
people! When she is so happy, so jolly&mdash;and loves God
more than all the rest of the people I know put together
love Him! It was to her it happened. <i>All I&rsquo;m doing is
tell it!</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;The twenty-third of April, the Principal of the High
School sent for Teresa to come to his office before she
went home. He told her that she was to graduate with
very highest honors and that he had got a Radcliffe
scholarship for her. It was Teresa&rsquo;s birthday. She was
sixteen. Teresa could hardly wait to get home to tell
her mother all the Principal had said. It would be Teresa
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
giving a birthday present to her mother, you see.
Mothers should have presents even more than the children
they have borne should have them, Teresa thinks.
For the mothers remember the birthdays and the children
can&rsquo;t.... She ran as fast as she could, the minute
she got out of the subway. She didn&rsquo;t care if people
stared at a grown-up girl racing through the streets.
She wanted so to get there with the wonderful news.
There was a crowd of people at the end of her street
held back by ropes. The air was full of smoke....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the bobolink soared, cascading rapture. Petra
stopped telling about Teresa&rsquo;s sixteenth birthday and
listened and watched with Lewis. But this time she did
not wait for the music to sink and fall away home; after
a breath or two she went on, her voice of necessity raised
a little, indenting itself through the bobolink&rsquo;s Gloria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole building where the Kerr family lived was
burned down to the pavement. Somebody told Teresa
that everybody had escaped except a woman who lived
in the top-story corner tenement and her six children.
They had all been burned alive. They came to the windows
too late for the fire ladders to reach them. They
must have been asleep when the fire started and waked
too late. The alarm was sounded a little after eight. Yes
... Teresa had left her mother and all the children
sleeping deeply. She and her father had got breakfast
together and gone out with infinite care not to wake
them,&mdash;she to school, he to his work in Cambridge. The
baby had had croup during the night, you see, and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
whole family had been disturbed by it. Even the younger
children. Teresa&rsquo;s mother had made a tent with sheets
over the crib, and boiled a kettle in it, and toward dawn
it was over and the baby was sleeping. The police had
learned there were six children in the family and that
was why they said six were burned. But Teresa, you see,
had gotten up early. She and her father. They had been
at infinite pains&mdash;I told you that&mdash;not to wake the
others. <i>Infinite pains.</i> The baby was sleeping naturally,
breathing softly when they stole out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a policeman who told Teresa about how the
mother and &lsquo;six&rsquo; children had come to the window. He
had seen them himself.... But a priest shoved him
one side. That was Father Donovan. He was their parish
priest. The Kerrs were Catholic. Teresa is a Catholic.
Teresa couldn&rsquo;t pray. But Father Donovan&rsquo;s praying
was really hers. He said, &lsquo;<i>My</i> mother, <i>my</i> brothers and
sisters, <i>my</i> baby brother. May perpetual light shine upon
them.&rsquo; ... They gave Teresa brandy. In the rectory.
They put it in hot tea. The housekeeper rubbed her
feet and hands, while Father Donovan called up all the
places her father might be. Father Donovan had thought
the police had made certain when they said that all <i>six</i>
Kerr children had come to the window, and until Teresa
got there, you see, he had no way of tracing her father.
But now Teresa gave the names and addresses. Finally
somebody said yes&mdash;Mr. Kerr was there. Father Donovan
said, &lsquo;Then keep him and don&rsquo;t let him know anything
until I come. I must tell him. Nobody else.&rsquo; But
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
the people didn&rsquo;t wait,&mdash;or something happened. I
don&rsquo;t know what. I can&rsquo;t ask Teresa. Perhaps she doesn&rsquo;t
know. Whether he died of the shock or whether he
killed himself&mdash;thinking all were burned.... All that
Teresa said was &lsquo;Father Donovan was in time to give
him absolution.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father Donovan boarded Teresa with his housekeeper&rsquo;s
sister. And she went on and got her diploma
and graduated from High School with very highest honors
in June. Nobody came to her graduation for by then
Father Donovan was dying of cancer. He had not told
Teresa until he had to. When he found he couldn&rsquo;t go
to the graduation, you see, he told her. She took her
diploma right to him. She ran to the rectory the minute
she was out. He blessed her and was as delighted and
proud as her mother would have been, Teresa says, and
her father, and her brothers and sisters. He told her that
his death would not be even an interruption to his prayers
for her goodness and happiness, and he asked her to
pray for him always, all her life. He died early the next
morning....</p>
<p>&ldquo;The week after Father Donovan died Marian found
Teresa through an employment agency, and she went to
Cape Cod for the summer with us. That was the summer
Marian began to be ill. Teresa and I did the work and
took care of her, and swam all the rest of the time. I
taught Teresa to swim and she was simply mad about
it. Marian had melancholia and Father was terribly unhappy
that summer. And I was selfish and cross,
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
having to wash so many dishes.... <i>But Teresa was
happy!</i>... Yes, it is true. She was the one who was
happy.... But gradually, I grew terribly happy too,
because of her. She didn&rsquo;t tell us anything about her
family or what had happened to them, only that they
were dead. Whenever I asked her about her brothers
and sisters who had died, she put me off. And Marian
never asked her anything, I think. She had merely
hired somebody who was to be one of the family and
work for less money because of that privilege. But above
all, Marian had chosen Teresa from all the other applicants
for the job at the agency because she seemed the
most <i>cheerful</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In September, when we went back to Cambridge,
Teresa wanted to use her scholarship and enter Radcliffe.
But Marian needed her so much and had come
to depend on her for everything so much&mdash;but most of
all it was her cheerfulness she needed&mdash;that Teresa
gave up college for that year and stayed on with us.
But she told Father and me, then, when she decided to
stay on with us, about the fire, and about the two sisters
who had died of pneumonia, and about how her mother
and father had wanted her to go to college. Father said
that she must go, of course, but that she was surely
young enough to wait a year. He was appalled about the
fire and said she must never tell Marian. It would be too
harrowing. And he was very sorry I had heard it....</p>
<p>&ldquo;The summer after that we couldn&rsquo;t afford the cottage
on the Cape and we stayed on in Cambridge. That
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
was bad for Marian. All the time that she was in the
apartment she spent in her bedroom on her chaise-longue.
But it was frightfully hot and she would get
wildly nervous and go out then to luncheons and tea
dances and places&mdash;looking very gay and well. But it
was only a false, nervous strength, the doctor said....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that fall you came, Doctor Pryne. Teresa and
I were so relieved! But you didn&rsquo;t have a chance. Marian
went away, and there was the divorce. But she went
away without saying anything to Teresa and me. We
came back from a day in the country in time to get dinner
that afternoon, and she was gone. That evening
Father explained it all to us&mdash;in words of one syllable,
you know,&mdash;what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teresa took it so hard that I don&rsquo;t remember how <i>I</i>
felt about it. I didn&rsquo;t feel anything, I think. I was so
surprised to hear Teresa <i>crying</i> that that was all I
thought about, really. It was as if the world was shaking
under us&mdash;under Father and me&mdash;with Teresa, of
all people, crying. But Father was angry with Teresa.
She said, you see, that he must bring Marian back. He
said he would not think of doing any such thing&mdash;that
she had a right to her freedom, if she wanted it. Teresa
started crying when Father said to us, &lsquo;I can honestly
say I am happy in Marian&rsquo;s happiness and I think she
has done exactly right. It&rsquo;s sheer stupidity for people
who are not happy together to go on pretending they
are. It is happiness that matters. There&rsquo;s at least one
person the happier in the world to-night, and any one
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
who really and genuinely cares for her must be glad
for her,&mdash;even if it means separation from her, of a
sort, and for a time. And after the divorce goes through,
you know, there&rsquo;s no reason in the world why we
shouldn&rsquo;t all be as good friends as ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Teresa cried just exactly as if somebody was
dead. And this time Father Donovan was dead too and
could not pray her prayers for her, while she cried.
That is what I thought, I remember, though I didn&rsquo;t
understand why she was crying like that. I was terribly
frightened by her crying like that&mdash;and Father&rsquo;s walking
the floor so white and angry with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clare came in about then. I think Father called her
up and asked her to come, to help him with Teresa. She
made Teresa drink some water. And then, when Teresa
was quiet, she said, &lsquo;You are a self-righteous, ignorant
girl. Mr. Farwell has the patience of a saint but this
is more than he can bear.&mdash;He is going to give you a
month&rsquo;s wages and you must go away. You are only
making things that are hard for him already much
harder.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went with Teresa while she packed her suit cases.
Clare called up Morris Place House and told them to
get a room ready for Teresa. She is a trustee there. She
ordered the taxi too, and told us when it came. She took
everything in charge, as if she were in Marian&rsquo;s place
already. But Teresa told the taxi-driver to go somewhere
else, not Morris Place House. She wasn&rsquo;t crying any
more but she looked ghastly. She wouldn&rsquo;t let me go
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
away with her but she promised never to forsake me.
And she never has. She is my guardian angel.... But
Clare doesn&rsquo;t know any more about Teresa now&mdash;how
she is, where she is&mdash;than she told you she did. And
she&rsquo;s not going to know. That is <i>something</i> I can do for
Teresa.... But you asked about her, Doctor Pryne.
You remembered her. And now I have told you about
her.... I really wanted to....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bobolink&rsquo;s Gloria had reached its climax minutes
ago and ceased. Petra&rsquo;s voice&mdash;when she had come to
telling how Clare had discharged Teresa and sent her
away, &ldquo;as if she were in Marian&rsquo;s place already&rdquo;&mdash;had
taken on the reticence of her eyes. It was not her personality
any more&mdash;that voice&mdash;not as it had been.
But the girl&rsquo;s eyes, now that both she and the bobolink
were silent, and Lewis looked at her, were thick with
tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what did Teresa do? Was it too late to get into
Radcliffe that fall? I suppose so. That was late autumn&mdash;nearly
three years ago. What did Teresa do? Where
did she go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis had to know. Teresa had become increasingly
real and important to him with every word that Petra
had said of her. Petra must go on, must tell it all, even
if she did cry, doing it.</p>
<p>But there were no tears in her voice. &ldquo;Yes, it was too
late for Radcliffe. Father had again, you see, persuaded
her to wait another year. But I went to see her the next
morning and she had a plan. She had decided to get
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
some kind of job&mdash;any kind&mdash;until she could begin
earning her way through Radcliffe in the shortest time
possible. In the end she meant to be a private secretary
and I would go and live with her. Then I would begin
going to Business School. We would both be independent
and I needn&rsquo;t live with Clare and Father. After Teresa
had gone away in the taxi, they told me, you see, that
they were going to be married as soon as the divorces
went through,&mdash;so it was a very relieving idea, to live
with Teresa and earn my own living. Teresa started in
to make it come true right away. And it was coming
true. She was all ready to graduate when&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petra broke off there, jumping up as if a bell had rung
for her, and her first duty in life was to answer it. But
it was only Dick Wilder, whistling to them from the
road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teresa was all ready to graduate and what happened?
It doesn&rsquo;t matter about Dick. Go on.&rdquo; Lewis was impatient
at the interruption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they want us. Clare has sent him for us. She
thinks I have kept you too long,&rdquo; Petra whispered, and
promised, quickly, under her breath, &ldquo;I will tell you
what happened the minute we are alone again. I want
to tell you. I want your advice, Doctor Pryne. Things
have happened.&mdash;But not now. Teresa is a secret here
at Green Doors. From Dick Wilder too. From everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick had come around the side of the house. &ldquo;Why
didn&rsquo;t you sing out?&rdquo; he inquired, astonished at finding
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
them there. &ldquo;I thought you must have passed up our
famous view and gone somewhere else, you two! Lowell
has turned up at last. But whatever&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick was silenced by a fresh astonishment. This was
stranger than their hiding and not answering,&mdash;Petra
crying. Of all things! And even Lewis was not quite
himself. Well, Dick knew nothing to do about it other
than to recommence talking faster than ever&mdash;which
he did&mdash;and somehow hurry them back to the elm and
Clare&rsquo;s management. He began explaining, very swiftly
and at some length, as they went, how little Sophia had
refused to let anybody but her mother feed her her
supper, and that that was why they&mdash;he and Clare&mdash;had
been gone such an unconscionably long while themselves,
and how, taking everything together, he was
afraid that Petra&rsquo;s father was feeling that they hadn&rsquo;t
any of them much realized that he had broken off his
work half an hour ahead of the usual time to join them
at tea, since nobody was anywhere near the tea table
when he came up from his studio.</p>
<p>Petra may have heard something of Dick&rsquo;s nervous
chatter. Lewis heard nothing. Left to himself, he would
never have been so docile under Dick&rsquo;s high-handedness,
of course. But Petra had shown such a passionate will
to obedience from the instant of the summoning whistle
that there was nothing else for Lewis but to seem docile
too.</p>
<p>And here they were back on the lawn again, going
down toward the group of chairs under the elm. Lowell
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
Farwell had risen and was standing, waiting for them.
He was more imposing even than the published portraits.
His leonine mane of frosty curls, his elegant but wide
shoulders, his height&mdash;and as they reached the shade
and were near enough&mdash;his luminous black eyes under
striking black brows, were the concrete and visible aspects
of a personality to conjure with.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<h2 id="c6"><i>Chapter Six</i></h2><div class="img"><img src="images/ch.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="30" /></div>
<p>Lewis had dined with his sister and her family
and now he and she were promenading her piazza.
Cynthia was like her name, fragrantly feminine, blond
and delightful, a cool petaled flower of New England.
They caught glimpses of Harry, her banker husband, as
they passed and repassed the living-room windows. He
was lying back in what might very well be the world&rsquo;s
most comfortable chair, reading the financial pages of the
<i>Transcript</i>, smoking his Corona, and supposedly enjoying
the jazz music which came blaring to him from a
Boston hotel through his radio; he had only to raise a
hand&mdash;no need even to lift his head&mdash;to turn the knob
which would produce a decent quiet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always promise myself when I&rsquo;m here that I will
come oftener,&rdquo; Lewis was saying. &ldquo;Then I get so devilish
busy I don&rsquo;t manage it. But now, Cynthia, it may be
different. You may be seeing too much of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice. I should love to see too much of you.
But <i>why now</i>? Oh! Green Doors, of course! And I&rsquo;ve
been trying to get you to go over there with me for a
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
year or more! You see why, now, don&rsquo;t you! It&rsquo;s fascinating,
isn&rsquo;t it! I feel, sometimes, when I&rsquo;m there, that the
very air is charged with a sort of electricity, if you know
what I mean, which you don&rsquo;t, since it doesn&rsquo;t express
what I mean. But it&rsquo;s all high spots, somehow. We must
seem commonplace to them, Harry and I. But Clare is
sweet to us, all the same. Even Lowell Farwell doesn&rsquo;t
seem bored. He and Harry discuss international affairs,
Russia and that sort of thing. And Clare herself is so
human. Isn&rsquo;t she beautiful&mdash;in an unusual way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why wouldn&rsquo;t Mrs. Farwell be human?&rdquo; Lewis
laughed. &ldquo;Do you imply that she is above or below the
norm? As to being beautiful&mdash;Petra is <i>really</i> beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Petra&mdash;really beautiful? Yes, I suppose she is. But
her features are too classical to be interesting, don&rsquo;t you
think? And she&rsquo;s so impassive. She&rsquo;s too big too. She&rsquo;ll
be positively statuesque some day. That type always develop
into Junos. Clare is frightfully sweet to her.
Frightfully patient. And what a background she&rsquo;s providing
her with! All it needs is just a little playing up to!
If she only knew how!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, background?&rdquo; Lewis asked
curiously. And he wondered, what had Petra ever done
to Cynthia to bring out such malice. Malice was no more
natural to Cynthia than to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think I mean?&rdquo; she exclaimed, a little
impatiently. &ldquo;The people she is meeting, of course.
Yourself to-day, for instance. How many times have you
gone anywhere socially during the last year, Lewis? Yet
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
you went to the Farwells&rsquo;. And you say you want to go
again, often. But it&rsquo;s not only celebrities. Socially, too,
Clare is giving Petra everything. This dinner dance tonight.
Dick says there isn&rsquo;t a man invited who isn&rsquo;t the
last word in eligibility. Why, Clare is providing Petra
opportunities any ordinary girl would give her eyes for.
And it&rsquo;s probably wasted. Men want more than mere
passive beauty these days. Temperament, vivacity are
what count. Clare doesn&rsquo;t realize it, of course, but the
very contrast between herself and Petra puts them off
Petra in spite of Clare&rsquo;s disadvantage in being married
and thirty. It couldn&rsquo;t help to. Wait till little Sophia
grows up, though. Then Clare will have her innings as
a mother. The little thing sparkles already! Personality
is a queer thing, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sometimes almost thought so,&rdquo; Lewis agreed
dryly. Then he asked, &ldquo;Can you tell me, Cynthia, why
Dick, who is adult, after a fashion&mdash;anyway, he isn&rsquo;t a
mere callow college boy&mdash;and seems practically to live
at Green Doors, hasn&rsquo;t fallen in love with Petra? And
she with him? It&rsquo;s a miracle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis meant his question earnestly. For hours now,
in his heart, he had been religiously grateful for the
miracle mentioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo; Cynthia asked. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you see
for yourself&mdash;this afternoon? Let&rsquo;s sit down. No&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t want a chair. You take it. I&rsquo;ll perch here on the
rail. Yes, do smoke. What an absolutely precious cigarette
case you&rsquo;ve got there! My dear, let me take it! How
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
delicious! Just feeling it in your hand is thrilling! A
present?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis nodded, but absently. Cynthia, as Dick had done,
refrained from commenting on the probable value of
the gift. If Lewis realized the value, he would only be
made uncomfortable by it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to know why Dick doesn&rsquo;t fall in love
with Petra Farwell? It&rsquo;s too obvious. How could a person
like Dick look twice at that gauche girl, with Clare
all the while in the same picture? Besides, Dick, more
than most moderns, is a romantic. It sticks out all over
him. He&rsquo;s an incorrigible idealist. But I&rsquo;m not worried
for Dick. He won&rsquo;t get his heart broken. Clare is too big
to let that happen. It&rsquo;s really the most civilizing thing
that could happen to him to be in love with a woman
like Clare at precisely this stage in his development.
Think of the color, the sheer beauty, the <i>depth</i> that
knowing Clare so well&mdash;even thinking he is breaking
his heart over her&mdash;is giving to Dick&rsquo;s life! As for
falling in love with a girl like Petra&mdash;why, he isn&rsquo;t
aware of her, except, perhaps, as one of Clare&rsquo;s problems.
Dick hasn&rsquo;t said anything to us&mdash;Harry and me&mdash;of
Petra&rsquo;s being a problem at Green Doors. Clare herself
is too selfless and big in every way ever to let on, of
course. But anybody can see! Clare&rsquo;s being so extraordinarily
sweet and patient only makes it stand out all the
more, how much a problem Petra is. Couldn&rsquo;t you see
it yourself, this afternoon, Lewis? Where&rsquo;s your psychology?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where is your own, Cynthia, my dear?&rdquo; Lewis&rsquo; voice
was oddly constrained, Cynthia thought, wondering at
it. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you look at Petra for yourself? It&rsquo;s obvious
you never have. You&rsquo;ve supinely accepted Clare&rsquo;s
version of her, without using your own intelligence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clare&rsquo;s version of Petra! But haven&rsquo;t I just been
saying that Clare is absolutely loyal to Petra? She defends
her, every time. She even goes so far as to call her
sullen silences &lsquo;reticence.&rsquo; And her vanity&mdash;Petra&rsquo;s obsessed
over clothes, thinks of nothing else&mdash;Clare
merely treats that as touchingly young and na&iuml;ve. Or
else she pretends that it&rsquo;s evidence of artistic appreciation
and taste. But if that&rsquo;s what it is, why doesn&rsquo;t it show
itself in other directions, now and then? I&rsquo;ve never seen
it. Why, the other day I mentioned something in her
father&rsquo;s last novel, and Petra had to admit she hadn&rsquo;t
even read it! Imagine! No, whatever Clare pretends
to herself and the rest of us about it, Petra is just plain
dull.... One is sorry for Clare, of course....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis was keeping only a tenuous hold on his good
temper. &ldquo;How can you be so dull yourself?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;She&mdash;Petra&mdash;is as far from dull as any human being
I&rsquo;ve ever had the honor to know. I suppose you&rsquo;ve seen
her nowhere but against the general unreality of Green
Doors. That&rsquo;s the &lsquo;background&rsquo; your Clare has given the
child.... Petra&rsquo;s truth, against her background&rsquo;s untruth,
has bewildered you. It hasn&rsquo;t me....&rdquo; He
lighted a fresh cigarette.</p>
<p>Cynthia flapped her arms and burst into as good an
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
imitation of a rooster crowing as is possible to the human
species. It was an accomplishment retained from childhood.
In those early days it had been, usually, the closing
note in some argument between brother and sister,
where Cynthia had been proven the winner; and now,
if ever, she knew herself right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lose! I win!&rdquo; she laughed, dropping her wings.
&ldquo;What good does it do you to be a psychiatrist? And
a famous one? Petra and truth! That girl would as soon
tell an out-and-out lie as wink. Clare never knows where
she is with her when it&rsquo;s a question of fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, so Clare <i>has</i> admitted that much&mdash;not excused
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it. You haven&rsquo;t caught <i>me</i>, darling, in a
fib. Clare couldn&rsquo;t excuse it or cover it up. It&rsquo;s too obvious.
Petra is always avoiding the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I got a hint of that myself this afternoon.
Couldn&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now that so suddenly and even surprisingly Lewis
had acknowledged her victorious in the scrimmage,
Cynthia felt a little remorseful. Not on Lewis&rsquo; account&mdash;he
could afford his losses&mdash;on Petra&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I needn&rsquo;t have been so malicious!&rdquo; she owned.
&ldquo;Come to think of it, I suppose Petra Farwell&rsquo;s never
had one atom of religious training. What is there to make
her feel an obligation to be truthful&mdash;or even grateful,
for the matter of that? She&rsquo;s never had a chance to
see life lived beautifully&mdash;till now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who of us has had religious training?&rdquo; Lewis
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
asked, surprised. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t. I certainly haven&rsquo;t. Your
own children haven&rsquo;t. What&rsquo;s that got to do with your
judgments on Petra, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be so logical, darling. I was only making
excuses for her, I suppose. But we are different, you
must admit. Lying doesn&rsquo;t come natural to us, does it!
And we are sincere....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it? Are we? Well&mdash;possibly. But then we
are at peace with our environment. Not in danger from
it. Our best policy is sincerity, telling the truth. If we
were living in a jungle, my dear, an unfriendly and mysterious
jungle, where we couldn&rsquo;t tell the trees from the
shadows, you know, we&rsquo;d fall back on protective coloring
and other hypocrisies, lies, wouldn&rsquo;t we? That&rsquo;s where
Petra&rsquo;s living. In a jungle. Where she can&rsquo;t tell the
shadows from the trees, if you want to know....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re being fantastic on purpose. Or else you&rsquo;re
overworking and not responsible!&rdquo; Cynthia accused and
then, suddenly, stopped breathing. How had they ever
got to talking like this, so earnestly, about Petra Farwell?
Lewis, anyway, who never talked personalities!
What had happened to him? Why was he looking so
strained and different? Was Lewis really interested in
Petra Farwell for herself&mdash;in some particular way?</p>
<p>For years Cynthia had wanted Lewis to marry. Her
husband agreed with her that, unmarried, the world was
losing much that her famous brother could give it. He
was terribly sweet with children. Her own four adored
him. And some of his best and most famous work had
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
been done with children. Besides, he was&mdash;although
Cynthia herself, being only his sister, could not quite see
why&mdash;extraordinarily magnetic to women. They pursued
him shamelessly. Avoiding that pursuit, both in
his work and socially, had developed into something approximating
an art in his contacts, Cynthia imagined. So
he had a world to choose from. If only he had met Clare
before Lowell Farwell met her! Cynthia had sighed this
sigh to herself before to-night. Clare would have been
perfect. But there were others. There must be. Lewis
needn&rsquo;t fall back on a Petra&mdash;a sullen, stodgy young
beauty, who wasn&rsquo;t even enough of a personality herself
to appreciate personality in another, in Clare. If Lewis
should be hypnotized by mere beauty and youth, and do
anything so stupid,&mdash;how simply ironic that would be!</p>
<p>Catching back her breath, Cynthia descended precipitately
from her perch on the piazza rail. She wanted
to be nearer Lewis. Physical nearness might help their
sympathetic nearness, which had been&mdash;she knew now&mdash;scattered
to the four winds when she flapped rooster
wings and crowed a minute ago. Besides, she had an
inspiration. She drew a chair close to his. The arms of
the two chairs touched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lewis!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do you remember that strange
book, &lsquo;Phantastes,&rsquo; by George MacDonald? We read it
together the summer after Father died. No, it was the
summer before. Aunt Cynthia read it to us. Those weeks
we stayed with her. That was the summer <i>before</i> Father
died, wasn&rsquo;t it? Anyway, we were really too young for
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
that book. But we got something out of it. I remember
parts quite vividly, every now and then.... Particularly
that gruesome bit about the Maid of the Alder.
Remember that? How she was so perfectly beautiful to
look at? Anodos thought so, anyway. And he went with
her that long walk through the forest and spent the night
with her in her cave? He thought she was the Lady of
the Marble&mdash;or was it Alabaster?&mdash;whom he had sung
to life and who had fled from him. He had never clearly
seen her face but she was his ideal woman, the woman
his soul was seeking. Now he thought he was to possess
her at last.... But when morning came and he woke,
his companion of the night had waked ahead of him and
was at the door of the cave, standing there, looking out.
Her back was turned to him.... Remember?...
She had had her desire of Anodos and she simply didn&rsquo;t
care now if he discovered that she was not his ideal
woman? She was perfectly careless that he should see how
she was hollow! Do you remember her standing there,
in the cave door, looking out into the forest&mdash;her hollow,
rotten back, like the stump of a decayed tree? Like
a coffin stood upon end? Wasn&rsquo;t it gruesome just!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cynthia was genuinely shuddering by this time. Lewis
laughed. &ldquo;I should say I do remember. That morning-after
scene darkened my boyhood,&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
read &lsquo;Phantastes&rsquo; through several times since that summer.
I keep it by me. I can&rsquo;t imagine&mdash;can you?&mdash;why
Aunt Cynthia chose that particular book for youngsters
like us? I suppose because of its fairy element&mdash;the enchanted
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
forest, and all. To my mind, it&rsquo;s one of the
world&rsquo;s deepest, wisest, but almost too obscurely mystical
books. Do <i>you</i> remember, Cynthia, how one begins to
feel the horror threatening Anodos&rsquo; soul&rsquo;s life, early, in
the very beginning of this Maid of the Alder business,
when he starts off with her on the walk to the cave? Your
first twinges of horror and dread for Anodos set in when
she takes such precautions to keep her face always
squarely toward him, walking backwards to accomplish
it, when necessary! Then, when they at last reach the
cave, she makes him go in <i>ahead</i> of her. Inside, she
always keeps her back to the wall. How horrible it is
when the lamp shines through her! Anodos should have
guessed then that she was hollow!... It is a nightmare....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Lewis! I meant&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid I meant&mdash;that
Petra Farwell, young girl though she is, has several
times made me remember the Maid of the Alder. I
haven&rsquo;t just made it up now. Truly. I thought of it the
last time I was at Green Doors. We were there for
dinner....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Petra&mdash;the Maid of the Alder! You&rsquo;re a little mad!
But it&rsquo;s rather a curious coincidence that I myself have
been brooding on &lsquo;Phantastes&rsquo; very lately, this afternoon,
in fact, at Green Doors and apropos of Petra too. Fact!
Do you remember Anodos&rsquo; song to his ideal woman&mdash;the
genuine one, not the imitation&mdash;through her shrouding
marble? It says how the world&rsquo;s sculptors in their
search for her have succeeded in embodying in their
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
creations no more than their ideas of what she may be.
They&rsquo;ve never taken hold of her living self. I even remember
some lines. Bless me if I don&rsquo;t!</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Round their visions, form enduring,</p>
<p class="t0">Marble vestments thou hast thrown;</p>
<p class="t0">But thyself, in silence winding,</p>
<p class="t0">Thou has kept eternally;</p>
<p class="t0">Thee they found not, many finding&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">I have found thee: wake for me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Lewis murmuring poetry in the dusk! And with the
little curly smile that with him, paradoxically, meant
utterest sincerity in what he was saying, even solemnity!
Cynthia&rsquo;s heart beat slowly and with a kind of awe at
the simplicity of the way in which Lewis&rsquo; curly smile
and his poetry had shut her up, permanently, on the
subject of Petra. The whole situation&mdash;trivial and really
nothing at all to Cynthia until only a minute ago&mdash;had
between a breath and a breath been lifted to the dignity
of a position on the knees of the gods, where she must
perforce leave it to its own developments in that realm
of pure fatality. And she thought they had been talking
lightly!</p>
<p>But now her brother was asking&mdash;casual again, thank
goodness&mdash;&ldquo;Have the kids gone up to bed yet? I&rsquo;m
terribly afraid I promised &rsquo;em a yarn after they were
packed away and that model starched nurse you indict
on &rsquo;em was well out of the picture. They&rsquo;ll be looking
for me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<h2 id="c7"><i>Chapter Seven</i></h2><div class="img"><img src="images/ch.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="30" /></div>
<p>Lewis was pledged to return to Green Doors at ten
o&rsquo;clock that evening. Cynthia and Harry, Clare was
aware, had made plans which would keep their cherished
guest occupied for all of Sunday, and he could not come
then. This was the only time left. She had made the
rendezvous under cover of walking up to the house
with Lewis when he was leaving Green Doors this afternoon.
He was to let himself in by the wicket gate and
she would meet him on the terrace, for Petra was not
to know that he had come back. Dick had explained her
scheme to him, had he not?</p>
<p>Yes, Dick had explained, and while at the time of the
explanation Lewis had had no intention of collaborating
with Mrs. Farwell in any schemes whatever, now he
agreed to return for a &ldquo;talk.&rdquo; Anything that touched
Petra&rsquo;s existence would have drawn him irresistibly back.</p>
<p>The great hall was wide open onto the terrace tonight,
as it had been this afternoon. It made an excellent
ballroom. It was a small party and every one was inside,
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
dancing. At least, as Lewis came up onto it, the terrace
seemed deserted.</p>
<p>His eyes found Petra first of all. She was dancing with
a tall, dark youth, over a restricted area in the center
of the floor. Lewis saw that the other girls were like
flowers in the black-coated arms of their partners&mdash;scarlet
flowers, blue, yellow, exotically scented. Or was
the perfume from the flowers on the terrace? In any case,
it harmonized with the exotic music. But the girls themselves
seemed too fragile for the voluptuous implications
of the perfume and the music. They were flowers drifting
on the dark current of sensuousness with petals not
yet sodden.</p>
<p>Lewis was amused at himself over his fancifulness but
it continued to spin itself along. If the girls there were
flowers, the boys were leaves. And the leaves, no more
than the flowers, belonged to the dark current under
the music; they were merely eddying over its surface,
vacant and bemused. It was strangely unreal, unconvincing&mdash;both
the would-be savage music and the
would-be voluptuous dancing.</p>
<p>But Petra was different. His eyes came back to her.
She was not bemused and she was too alive to drift. So
her dancing was out of key and came near to awkwardness.
Given solid earth, she could run fleetly, beautifully,
Lewis was certain,&mdash;a Diana, spirit and body one. But
she was too alive and too vital to find herself in this
syncopated dalliance with a shadow world of sensuousness.
Passion, for her to recognize it, must be bright,
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
whole, burning with sun. Lewis was not amused now at
his thought. He knew what he knew about Petra, and
his heart offered up a gratitude that was religious in the
knowing.</p>
<p>Clare stole up and stood beside him. She had been
watching for his arrival, sitting with Dick in the shadow
of a tall flower-grown urn. She had sent the young man
back to the party peremptorily and with some excitement
the instant the older and more eminent visitor appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they precious!&rdquo; she exclaimed, her fingers
just touching Lewis&rsquo; arm. &ldquo;All of them! But my Petra
in particular? In that frosty gown!&mdash;Come to the library.
We can&rsquo;t talk against this racket. Lowell&rsquo;s in town
speaking to a meeting of the Boston Authors&rsquo; Club,
otherwise he would be hiding in the library himself. He
detests jazz. Except when your brother-in-law plays it.
Harry&rsquo;s jazz is superb. He makes it art!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The library was a surprisingly small room but its
walls rose through two stories with books all the way
up to the high ceiling. A mild, yellow and diffused light,
radiating from unseen sources, would make reading here&mdash;even
at the top of the book ladder&mdash;as easy for the
eyes as if it were broad day.</p>
<p>Clare settled herself in a corner of the very low,
built-in modern divan which extended down one entire
length of the room, and Lewis, obedient to her gesture,
sat down, experimentally, beside her. He had had little
practice with modernistic furniture such as this, which,
he was learning now, demanded a new technique in
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
posture, unless one were built on angular lines and accustomed
to lolling. It would quite suit Farwell, for
instance, whose divan it was. But Lewis, who was stocky
rather than angular, found himself having to bend in all
the wrong places to adapt himself to it. Mrs. Farwell,
however, was perfectly at home. She had drawn her feet
up under her, Japanese fashion, and sat now perched
on her heels, wand-straight, small and exquisite. But then,
she was as supple-bodied as a child and as poised as a
dancer in every attitude that she assumed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am really delighted,&rdquo; she was saying, &ldquo;that you
have come, like this. If I had gone into town some day,
instead, and seen you in your office, everything would
have been so different. I should have had to <i>tell</i> you
about things. We may have saved weeks, don&rsquo;t you think
so, Doctor Pryne, in getting you here where you can
see it all for yourself and needn&rsquo;t draw it out bit by bit
with questions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clare&rsquo;s evening gown was flame-colored taffeta, her
jewels pearls, her feet&mdash;out of sight but remembered&mdash;were
sandal-shod with gold heels, curved like dagger
blades. It was an elegance in striking contrast to the simplicity
and seeming carelessness of her afternoon&rsquo;s appearance.
But Lewis felt no contrast. It was all of the
same piece: all part of the game. And when he looked
away from her, which he did rather quickly in very
shame for the ungenerosity of every thought he seemed
able to think concerning Petra&rsquo;s stepmother, it was only
to find her voice increasing his prejudice. No matter
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
what ideas her words in themselves conveyed, certain
inflections in the tones seemed to be asking over and
over, &ldquo;What do you think of me, what do you think of
me, <i>what do you think of me</i>?&rdquo; It was the eager and
unappeasable cry of an insatiate vanity. Lewis hated himself
for hearing it so plainly; but his nerves were taut.
When had Doctor Pryne allowed himself the excuse of
nerves before! Yet to be so near Petra and shut away
in here with Mrs. Farwell!</p>
<p>He wound his arms around his knees. That was it. That
was what you had to do to come to terms with this
fantastic divan. Stick your knees up, almost to your chin,
and then not to be altogether too orang-utan-like, wind
your arms. The only alternative would be to sit on your
feet, as his hostess was doing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There wouldn&rsquo;t have been any need for you to come
to my office,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Not to talk about Petra. She is
the last person in the world, to my mind, to need psychiatric
treatment.&rdquo; He might as well get this part over
quickly, Lewis felt.</p>
<p>Clare was surprised by the dry conviction with which
Lewis spoke, but she was not warned. She swayed toward
him, from her heels, and put her hand on his arm. The
gesture was as unselfconscious, and un-sex-conscious, as
if she were a child of ten. Lewis was aware of her unconsciousness
all the time that her fingers stayed there,
pressing into his coat sleeve, and her soft warm breath
was almost on his cheek. He wondered whether she
pawed Dick like this, with casual unselfconsciousness,&mdash;and
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
whether Dick found it engagingly innocent. Dick
was just the sort of romantic youth&mdash;Lewis hadn&rsquo;t
needed Cynthia to explain Dick to him&mdash;to confuse
sexual paucity with purity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you don&rsquo;t understand what we meant then,
Richard and I,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;Psychiatry&mdash;anyway as
you practise it, Doctor Pryne&mdash;is not for diseased minds
merely. Petra is terribly sane. Saner than I am, I&rsquo;m certain
of that. It is something less tangible I am asking
your help with. I want you to make it possible for my
stepdaughter to be true to herself and to be happy.&mdash;That
wasn&rsquo;t Petra&rsquo;s true self you saw this afternoon. I
know, Doctor, that it is your faith, as much as it is mine,
that most people want to find themselves and be true to
themselves, to their best selves, I mean, if only they can
be shown how. If you <i>hadn&rsquo;t</i> that faith in human nature,
then you couldn&rsquo;t do for people what you do. You see
I know something about your work. Mrs. Dickerman is
one of my intimate friends. Cornelia James too. I&rsquo;ve
known Cornie ever since we were at Miss Foster&rsquo;s School
together. So I know, for I have seen, how you took at
least one woman and made her into a charming, agreeable
person when she was over thirty. Why, Cornie was
the most morbid, oversensitive and unhappy soul until
you began treating her!&mdash;And even if I hadn&rsquo;t seen
these miracles, I&rsquo;d still know from reading your books
what you can do for people in the way of orientating
them with their own highest potentialities. And all I am
asking, Doctor Pryne, is that you should do that for my
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
Petra. You do believe, don&rsquo;t you, that it isn&rsquo;t natural to
her&mdash;can&rsquo;t be natural to any one&mdash;to be so secretive
and indifferent as she seems? Not at nineteen, anyway!
And with Lowell Farwell for a father&mdash;and I so devoted
to her!&rdquo;&mdash;Clare&rsquo;s fingers had relaxed their steady
pressure but she was slow to remove them from Lewis&rsquo;s
coat sleeve.</p>
<p>Lewis might have laughed. He frowned to save himself
from doing so; for it would not have been a pleasant
laugh and the frown was, at least, silent. Clare was not
the first blasphemous wealthy woman who had tried,
casually and even patronizingly, to buy his services as a
cure of souls for themselves or members of their family.
But in this instance it was Petra&rsquo;s reserve&mdash;that clean,
sword-edged reserve&mdash;he was being asked to violate.
Yes, this woman was looking forward to his pulling
Petra all apart, like the works of a clock, and laying
the pieces on the table, for them to mull over together.</p>
<p>He could hear Mrs. Lowell Farwell expatiating on
it to her next dinner partner. Yet, no. She would hardly
do that. It would be worth saving until the conversation
was general. &ldquo;Oh, yes. Doctor Pryne is psychoanalyzing
my stepdaughter. He is frightfully interested in her case.
It is too wonderful what he has done for her already.
She&rsquo;s a different person. Oh, but you must know who he
is! Doctor Lewis Pryne! He wrote &lsquo;Learning to be
Adult.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, yes! Mrs. Farwell would exploit it for all it was
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
worth at dinners, luncheons, teas and in the arms of dancing
partners for weeks to come, while all the time the
inflections in her voice demanded, &ldquo;What do you think
of me, what do you think of me, what do you think of
<i>me now</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only, of course she would not&mdash;because she could
not. Fortunately she had come to the wrong counter.
Lewis had nothing to sell her&mdash;but, on second thoughts,
something, possibly, that he would give her for nothing;
for it had suddenly occurred to him that if he failed her
entirely to-night, she might try elsewhere. There <i>were</i>
psychoanalysts quite the sort she imagined him to be,
of course. Would Petra, with Mrs. Farwell setting her
heart on it, have the hardihood to stand out against going
through the fashionable paces of being psychoanalyzed?
He must do what he could to avoid such a possible
calamity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This question of finding one&rsquo;s self,&rdquo; he murmured,&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s
living one&rsquo;s life, isn&rsquo;t it, that accomplishes that, in
the end? Petra is too young to have found herself in
that sense, of course. But she is old enough, on the other
hand, to want to. That may be the conflict, the cause of
all her &lsquo;indifference&rsquo; to you and her life here. She said
something to me this afternoon about wanting to go to
business school and be independent. Wouldn&rsquo;t her father
send her? That would be cheaper, anyway, and infinitely
more sensible than having her psychoanalyzed. She
could get quite away from Green Doors. Live in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
Girls&rsquo; Studio Club&mdash;or perhaps even set up an apartment
with some girl friend....&rdquo; He was, of course,
thinking of Teresa.</p>
<p>It had the effect, anyway, of removing Mrs. Farwell&rsquo;s
hand from his arm. She was back in her corner,
looking at him with surprise and even doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Petra didn&rsquo;t tell you that she wanted to get away
from Green Doors and all I am doing for her here? Did
she? Petra didn&rsquo;t actually say&mdash;this afternoon, the minute
you were alone with her&mdash;that she was unhappy?
Did she? I simply don&rsquo;t understand, Doctor Pryne!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why are you surprised?&rdquo; Lewis evaded. &ldquo;I
gathered from young Wilder when he came to my
office on Thursday that that was how things were with
Petra. You felt she was abnormally indifferent to you,
he said, and to all the nice things you were trying to
do for her and to give her. But, do you know, now I&rsquo;ve
seen Petra, that indifference seems perfectly healthy to
me? She is, after all, not a child. She&rsquo;s a woman. <i>Let</i> her
learn a profession and be independent! Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Farwell was growing wider and wider eyed.
Then suddenly Lewis knew what he should have
guessed: Clare had never really believed that Petra was
antagonistic to her. She had thought her indifference and
reticence merely temperamental idiosyncrasies. In fact,
she had in all sincerity thought Petra what she had made
Cynthia think her, a girl deficient in sensibility. So she
was only tampering with Petra&rsquo;s temperament, or rather,
asking Lewis to tamper with it, for the sake of drawing
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
him&mdash;Doctor Lewis Pryne&mdash;into the Farwells&rsquo; &ldquo;interesting&rdquo;
circle. Modern morbid psychology was much
in the air these days. Being psychoanalyzed by &ldquo;well-known&rdquo;
doctors had become a fashionable pastime. Having
one&rsquo;s stepdaughter, to whom one was in every way
so marvelously generous, psychoanalyzed, and then oneself
discussing the case in the wings, as it were, with the
famous psychiatrist <i>ad infinitum</i>, would be a new way to
play the game.</p>
<p>A strained laugh from Clare interrupted Lewis&rsquo; bitter
train of thought. &ldquo;I am afraid Petra has been deceiving
you, rather,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;What I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> understand
is how she managed it, and in so short a time, with you,
who are so&mdash;so wise. She must have deliberately set
out to engage your sympathies the minute I left her
alone with you. But why? And as for a girl like Petra
living at the Studio Club&mdash;after Green Doors&mdash;can
you imagine it, really? Don&rsquo;t tell me <i>she</i> suggested
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; Lewis answered. &ldquo;As a matter of fact,
she would be more restricted in her freedom there than
here, I suppose. But with a friend, then&mdash;in an apartment&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the laugh. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know Petra, Doctor
Pryne! She hasn&rsquo;t an intimate friend to her name. I
invite girls here, of course, all the time. They come,
enjoy themselves with each other and the boys, and
invite Petra to their homes in return. But as for friends,
she simply doesn&rsquo;t make them. She hasn&rsquo;t the gift of
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
friendship. It&rsquo;s one of my worries about her,&mdash;one of
the things I thought your analysis of her might cure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s Teresa. That&rsquo;s one friend, at least,
Teresa&mdash;&rdquo; Too late Lewis knew himself a traitor to
Petra&rsquo;s confidences, and broke off, embarrassed and
sorry. But to his great relief, Clare seemed not to have
even heard. She was repeating, but almost as if for her
own ears, and very softly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand. Petra
took you to the guest house to show you the river view.
That is all the time you two were together. And in that
short while Petra conveyed to you that she was unhappy
here and wanted to get away. Why, it&rsquo;s unbelievable!
How could even Petra be quite so&mdash;so outrageous as
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But mightn&rsquo;t Petra think it a little outrageous of us,
of you and me, to be discussing her here now, as we are
doing?&rdquo; Lewis inquired reasonably. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t <i>she</i>
be wounded&mdash;and angry? I don&rsquo;t see any difference,
really....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shock dried the tears, just gathered, from the widened
eyes which were turned on him. If Clare had taken anything
for granted, as certain to result from to-day&rsquo;s anticipated
contact with this supposedly brilliant psychiatrist,
it was that he would be deeply impressed by her beautiful
disinterested kindness toward this girl who had no
natural claim on her whatever. But from the very first
minute, so Clare began to think now, Doctor Pryne had
missed everything of what should have been obvious to
him. He had no subtlety then! But if this were true,
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
why was everybody so mad about him and how could he
be a successful doctor of souls! That was what Lowell
called him, and he was even talking of putting him into
his next novel,&mdash;disguised, of course. And then the
miracles he worked! You simply had to have penetration
of some sort, understanding of some sort, to do for personalities
what he had done for Julia Dickerman, Cornie
and all the rest! But even without any extraordinary
amount of penetration you would expect him to see that
it was both disloyal and cheap for Petra to have confided
in him as she must have done this afternoon, the very
minute they were alone together.</p>
<p>Suddenly Clare gave up the idea of being hurt by
Petra&rsquo;s astounding disloyalty. She would be too generous,
too big to think of herself in the situation at all. But
she understood now that she would have to <i>say</i> to this
man whatever it was she wanted him to know. No use
trusting to his discerning anything! That was what Petra
had done, apparently. Said things. Simply because Petra
had said things, Doctor Pryne had believed them&mdash;and
that in spite of all that he should have seen and all that
Clare had meant him to see for himself! Well, she&mdash;Clare&mdash;would
have to descend to Petra&rsquo;s crude methods.
She would explain herself to this exasperating person
in words and expound her relations with Petra. But
she would leave the malice to Petra. The very contrast
between her generosity and Petra&rsquo;s smallness ought to
speak for itself. He simply could not be so obtuse as to
miss that much&mdash;or could he?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>She refrained from touching him, although her impulse
had again been to put her fingers on his arm. Instinctively
she had a minute ago come to feel that physical
contact made this particular man uncomfortable. But
the urgency of Clare&rsquo;s fingers&rsquo; pressure was transferred
to her voice when she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid that you have begun by misunderstanding
almost everything, Doctor Pryne. But it doesn&rsquo;t matter.
I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t matter that you consider Petra justified
in her attitude toward me and what I am trying to do
for her, as you seem to. What does matter&mdash;all that I
care about at all&mdash;is Petra&rsquo;s good. It is for her own
sake I want her to become adjusted and happy, an integrated
personality. It is not for my sake. Not even for
her father&rsquo;s. And if you are right and I ought to give
her up, let her go away,&mdash;why, then I hope I am unselfish
enough to let her try it. But why business school&mdash;of
all things, for a daughter of Lowell Farwell&rsquo;s? It
will be interesting to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she gave Lewis no chance to answer that. She
hurried on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;First you must tell me everything she said to you.
I don&rsquo;t mean what she may have said about Green Doors,
her home here, or me. No, I am afraid hearing that
would hurt too much. But what she wanted different.
Let us just concentrate on the positive side of things and
let the negative go.... You see, even if you won&rsquo;t
take her as a patient, in the way I hoped you would take
her, I still need your advice, your wisdom, Doctor. For
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
in those brief moments you were alone with my stepdaughter,
you seem to have come nearer to understanding
her than I have in the years of our close association. You
made her articulate for once. That in itself is something.
Petra, articulate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused there, but only to draw Lewis&rsquo; glance to
her face. &ldquo;You see, my husband can&rsquo;t help me with
Petra.&rdquo; Her eyes probed in the shallows of Lewis&rsquo; cold,
sleepy gaze. &ldquo;He is out of it, even if she is his own
daughter. There is almost nothing of sympathy between
them. That is what I have been working for, ever since
my marriage, to help them to a more happy relationship.
I have dreamed that Lowell might come to love
the daughter of his youth as he loves our little Sophia.
He adores the baby. But that, I am afraid, is merely
because she is mine, and her very existence makes <i>me</i>
more his. That is the way it is in happy marriages, of
course. Father-love is all bound up in the father&rsquo;s love
for the mother. But Lowell, you see, loved Petra&rsquo;s
mother (if you can call it love)&mdash;well, differently&mdash;and
that is why Petra herself&mdash;I have figured it out&mdash;means
so little to him....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Clare kept her fingers from Lewis&rsquo; coat sleeve
but she actually clutched her hands on her lap to accomplish
it. And she swayed toward him, her eyes insisting
on holding his cold gaze. Her whole vivid, quicksilver
face was alive with her intention to make Lewis her
ally, to win from him something at last, of what she had
intended to win when she invited him back to-night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mind my telling you intimate things like
this?&rdquo; she asked naively. &ldquo;I had meant to tell them and
had everything&mdash;all the information you could need&mdash;organized,
you see. Even now, when you say that Petra
doesn&rsquo;t need psychoanalyzing, I still rather want to tell
you. Before you are sure you are right about the wisdom
of Petra&rsquo;s leaving her father and me, giving up her life
here with all its advantages, you ought to know a little
more about the child herself, don&rsquo;t you think? I see
now&mdash;you have let me see&mdash;that my Petra herself,
as a person, interests you, quite aside from your psychiatry.
And I am grasping at that interest as at a straw,
Doctor. I am so alone in my concern for this child and
in my dreams for her! I&rsquo;m not mistaken? You <i>are</i> interested,
aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; This time at last the lady required
an answer&mdash;waited for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am very much interested,&rdquo; Lewis admitted,
after a mere instant&rsquo;s hesitation. But all the same he
looked toward the door. If only Petra herself would
appear there! Come in, in her frosty gown! Interrupt
this really silly performance. He did not need any one to
explain Petra to him. It was her presence he wanted. One
meeting of their eyes had told him more than all the
volumes Mrs. Lowell Farwell could say with that overtone
in her voice which insisted on bending his understanding
to her own interpretations of Petra&mdash;or more
subtly yet, what she meant him to think were her interpretations.
Really he could not doubt that Clare must
know, as simply as he knew, that Petra did not need
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
either of them; the integration of her young self was a
perfected accomplishment and all the more perfected
for having the seal of her reticence upon it.</p>
<p>Suddenly now Lewis knew why the blue gentians,
there in the Cambridge apartment where first he saw
Petra, had stayed so sharply etched on his memory. Petra
herself was like a blue gentian,&mdash;a secret, brave flower
springing from an arid soil. Lewis remembered &ldquo;The
Wind Boy,&rdquo; a story he had bought lately for his nephews
and read through before giving them. The little girl in
that story was named Gentian, and her brother explained
it: &ldquo;Father always said that one small gentian had all
the sky folded around in its soft fringes. Gentian magic.
Cold and frost don&rsquo;t scare it, for it has the whole sky
held close to give it company and heart....&rdquo; Well,
that was true of Petra, just as it was true of the little girl
in the fairy tale. But what made it true, how Petra had
appropriated the blue sky and held its secrets as her own,
where she had lain hold of it,&mdash;that Lewis could not
guess.</p>
<p>Clare at this moment was vastly encouraged by the
light which played&mdash;palpably&mdash;over the doctor&rsquo;s lips
and almost rose in his cold sleepy eyes This was approaching
the way she had imagined things would go
between them when they really got to talking intimately,
and he began to see her in the way she intended he
should see her. Before she was through with telling him
about Petra to-night&mdash;the excuse for the t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te&mdash;this
light of appreciation and admiration for herself
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
would have become established unequivocally in the
cold sleepy eyes. She had not a moment&rsquo;s doubt of it.
Nothing in past experience had instilled trepidation or
the imagination of the possibility of failure into this sex-unconscious
flirt whose line (she acknowledged it to herself
and was quite simply proud of it) was spiritual
<i>rapport</i> with interesting male personalities in the higher
areas of contact. If passion developed in the course of
these spiritual contacts, it was merely a sign, on a slightly
lower plane, that all had gone well in the upper airs.
It was a sign, in fact, that Clare&rsquo;s vanity, though not her
senses, ultimately demanded.</p>
<p>Her eyes fell from Lewis&rsquo; cold eyes to his mouth. She
thought cleverly (she was far from stupid): &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a face
of frozen passion. Not cold. It is all there. But frozen
by asceticism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was suddenly, hardly understanding why herself,
extraordinarily excited.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<h2 id="c8"><i>Chapter Eight</i></h2><div class="img"><img src="images/ch.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="30" /></div>
<p>Lewis continued to see a blue gentian etched on
air, all the while Clare told him about Petra. But he
heard her, well enough, in spite of the vision he was
contemplating, and outwardly he was attentive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lowell was frightfully young when he married
Petra&rsquo;s mother. And the attraction between them&mdash;it&rsquo;s
almost inevitable in early marriages like that, I suppose&mdash;was
merely physical. So, when he waked up to
that, it wasn&rsquo;t nearly enough, not for a person like Lowell
Farwell, anyway. But the only reason one need even remember
that early tragedy is the way it still affects Petra.
Her father got the idea, almost from the day she was
born, that she was her mother over again. She was
physically like her, in the first place. They say that Ann
was a great beauty. Lowell says she was even more beautiful
than Petra. But it wasn&rsquo;t the physical resemblance
that repelled Lowell most and still hurts. It was her
mind and temperament. He got the idea that Petra had
a commonplace mind, ordinary. Like her mother. And
now, nineteen years after, she is still for him an echo&mdash;a
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
reverberation&mdash;of an old disappointment. It seems
cruel, I know. But he can&rsquo;t help himself, and one can
understand, don&rsquo;t you think?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand, anyway. And it is appalling to think
that if Petra&rsquo;s mother hadn&rsquo;t happened to die, Lowell
might still be bound to her. She was puritanical or fundamentalist
or something. Whatever the particular cult was,
it was stupid and narrow and forbade divorce. She
thought herself religious! Imagine calling such cruelty
religion! But Providence had mercy, if she didn&rsquo;t. She
didn&rsquo;t believe in birth control any more than she did
in divorce, and she died when the second child was born,
when Petra was only one year old. That, if anything,
gives you the picture of how impossible Petra&rsquo;s mother
made things for her young, penniless, genius-husband&mdash;having
another child right away. But the new baby was
premature and fortunately lived only a little while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lowell was through with marriage, he thought then,
for all time. His religious wife had seared his faith
in the sweetness of it as a human relation. But though
seared, his faith was not actually destroyed. It has never
been destroyed. Lowell Farwell has been bigger than
the things life has done to him. Six or seven years later
he saw Elsa Larsen in &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet&rsquo; at Munich.
Elsa Larsen&rsquo;s acting was beautiful enough to break your
heart. When she stuck to Shakespeare, anyway. She was
really a great actress, even if this country never woke
up to her. Did you ever see her? I saw her first in
Munich, when I was a young girl. I spent the year I was
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
twelve abroad with my mother. We went to the National
Theater dozens of times to see Elsa Larsen in her
Shakespeare roles. I never dreamed then that I should
marry her husband one day! I may even have seen him,
without knowing or remembering, in the theater. They
were married inside of a week after they met. It was a
perfectly wild marriage, of course. The result of utter
loneliness on his part, mad infatuation on hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Larsen killed herself. Yes, I know it isn&rsquo;t known.
And it <i>is</i> shocking. But she did it. She ran the car into
those park gates on purpose. She meant to kill Lowell
at the same time. He was begging her to get a divorce
from him or let him get it, and she simply lost her head
and drove straight into the gates. She saw that they were
closed in plenty of time to have swerved. Lowell is
certain of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what I want you to see and think about, Doctor,
is Petra, of course. They put her in boarding school and
she stayed there vacations and all, the few years till the
so-called accident. But when poor Marian made Lowell
think he had compromised her&mdash;yes, every one except
Lowell himself, it seems, pretty well understood that
little drama Marian staged at the Tillotsons&rsquo; house party&mdash;well,
when Marian became Petra&rsquo;s second stepmother,
there wasn&rsquo;t enough money to keep the child on at boarding
school. Larsen spent all she earned and left nothing.
They lived huddled up in that dreary little apartment
in Cambridge with only one servant to do the work. How
Marian hated it! She never lifted her hand for Petra
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
or gave her a thought, except to resent her being there
at all, one could see. But the thing Marian has really
to blame herself for, to my mind, is the way she left the
child to the sole companionship of whatever general-housework
girl happened to be in possession of the place
at the time. I myself was so appalled at seeing what
Petra&rsquo;s life was like when I met them, that even if I
hadn&rsquo;t fallen head over heels in love with Lowell I
should have married him, almost, to rescue his daughter.
All that was maternal in me was roused and fighting.
That day I met you there&mdash;remember?&mdash;my heart
was broken for Petra....</p>
<p>&ldquo;So now you can see why I can&rsquo;t blame Petra for any
seeming disloyalty she may have displayed this afternoon
in the talk you had with her. She has never known
what it was to be loved before. How should she be
counted on to return it, or even to be loyal to it? It is
asking too much&mdash;even after three years, I think. But
you see why I am grateful for your interest in her, and
why I am ready, almost without questioning it, to act
on any advice you care to give&mdash;now that you know
the child&rsquo;s miserable history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she had been talking, Clare&rsquo;s eyes had now and
then been starry with tears, and on the final words one
or two actually fell. She wiped them away, quite simply,
with a handkerchief. She had no need to consider her
make-up, as she never wore any.</p>
<p>Lewis withdrew his thought from a blue gentian,
etched on air. He untied himself somehow and struggled
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
up from his low place at Clare&rsquo;s side. He asked if he
might smoke. Clare had not remembered to offer him a
cigarette because she herself did not smoke any more than
she used make-up; but at once she was all charming
apologies for her neglect and motioned him toward the
supply near at hand. But Lewis, apologetic himself, preferred
his own variety. He got out his case, lit a Lucky,
took a deep inhalation,&mdash;and laughed.</p>
<p>Clare did not understand the laugh, considering all
she had been saying to him&mdash;and her tears. But she
waited. She had done what she could to make herself
clear to him and it was his turn now. He must have
some reaction other than that ambiguous laugh to all
that she had said&mdash;and <i>looked</i>&mdash;during the past minutes.</p>
<p>He was pacing back and forth before the long divan,
his hands deep in the already sagging pockets of his
tweed jacket. They did not dress for dinner at the
Allens, and Lewis was in Meadowbrook without his
dress clothes. But when after a few seconds of this rather
surprising behavior, the man whirled and stood before
her, looking down at her, his face, at last, was beginning
to mirror something&mdash;she was almost certain&mdash;of what
she was. Clare thought she saw her generosity reflected
in Doctor Pryne&rsquo;s face as in a mirror. And on account
of that true reflection of herself, she forgave him all the
bewilderment and uncertainty he had for just a little
while caused her. It was rather wonderful having his
cold, sleepy eyes no longer cold and sleepy but aware of
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
her. She had known all along of course that Doctor
Lewis Pryne was a person of rare power and magnetism,
but until this instant she had missed the biting tang of
actually feeling it. To her own surprise her heart beat
fast. Madly!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo; he was asking. &ldquo;Do you really
want advice from me? For I know what I would do in
your place and I would do it like a shot. Shall I say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked back up at him. Was this hypnotism? She
felt excitedly supine&mdash;submissive&mdash;open to this man&rsquo;s
will....</p>
<p>Her eyes, grave&mdash;and she herself knew how lovely!&mdash;promised
him she was ready to do whatever he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;&mdash;But how dry his voice sounded! And
already he had stopped looking at her!&mdash;&ldquo;First of all,
I should cut off that absurd allowance. Two thousand a
year, Petra said it was, and just for clothes! And then
I should encourage her to take the job waiting for her in
my office. It&rsquo;s a good job. It can begin on Monday morning
at nine o&rsquo;clock. And I wouldn&rsquo;t fuss any more about
trying to create sympathy between father and daughter.
It is too late. The time is past. Petra has had, I suppose,
a pretty bad deal from the beginning, but from now on
she ought to be her own environment maker. You can&rsquo;t
possibly go on doing it for her. Have you ever heard
the phrase: &lsquo;Environment is hidden identity&rsquo;? I believe
that that is perfectly true of any personality, given half
a chance. It&rsquo;s time Petra had her chance. Marriage and
a home where she herself is the protecting force&mdash;that&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
the ultimate answer. But as a stop-gap right now, a job.
That&rsquo;s what I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Clare had sent for Petra and they were waiting. Lewis
wandered over to the massive, built-in library table. It
was shaped like a scimitar. The last words in biography,
essays, poetry and fiction of two continents seemed to be
here under his hand, most of the volumes still in their
bizarre paper jackets. In the midst of the bright jumble
stood two large heavy silver frames holding photographs.
One was Clare, the other Petra. Petra was in evening
dress and her posture and expression must have been
dictated by the photographer. The eyes in particular
were self-conscious and static in their inexpressive trance.
The mouth alone was sentient, not even the stare of the
photographer and the camera together having succeeded
in betraying it into insincerity. Clare&rsquo;s photographed face,
on the other hand, was vibrant, with just the hint of a
candid smile dawning in eyes and lips. She was not in
evening dress but had been taken in a simple blouse
with a soft turnover collar. Of the two photographs,
hers was much the more interesting and alluring. And
so Lowell Farwell must think every time he noticed the
two faces in juxtaposition here on his table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just one of Clare&rsquo;s little touches,&rdquo; Lewis told himself,
wincing. But now he was to get Petra away, out of
it. That was exhilarating. He took Petra&rsquo;s photograph
into his hands. He was studying it, and Clare from her
corner of the divan was watching him curiously, when
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
Petra finally came in. Clare beckoned Petra to the deserted
place beside her while Lewis replaced the photograph
to the exact spot on the desk from which he had
taken it, and sat down on the arm of a chair facing the
divan and the two living, breathing women contrasted
there. He lighted a fresh cigarette but did not offer
Petra one, remembering her afternoon&rsquo;s embarrassment.</p>
<p>He began at once. &ldquo;You know what you said this afternoon,
Petra, about wanting to learn stenography and becoming
ultimately somebody&rsquo;s private secretary? Well, I
have a job for you that will begin paying right away,
and you can practise shorthand and typewriting in your
spare moments. It&rsquo;s in my office, assistant to my secretary.
Miss Frazier is overworked. Has been for some
time. It has been getting more and more on my conscience
lately.&rdquo; This was perfectly true. &ldquo;But with another
girl in the reception office to receive the patients,
answer the telephone, and take the preliminary records,
I&rsquo;ll not worry. You can begin Monday morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis&rsquo; voice showed nothing of the elation he was
feeling. His tone, in fact, was dry and his look constrained.
But Petra, as well as he, had herself well in
hand, it seemed. Reticence had leapt to her eyes with
almost his first words&mdash;a sword on guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darling! What <i>is</i> the matter?&rdquo; Clare demanded, but
without much genuine surprise. She had never expected
that Petra would be delighted by Doctor Pryne&rsquo;s offer
of this job. She knew her stepdaughter&rsquo;s love of freedom
and luxury too well, she thought. And when Petra
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
learned that her allowance was to be cut as well as her
days filled with work, Clare imagined she would not
even consider Doctor Pryne&rsquo;s astonishing proposition.
Why, this very month Petra had borrowed ahead on her
allowance, to pay for the frock she had worn this afternoon.
She was always borrowing ahead. She spent more
on her clothes than Clare spent on her own. Petra considered
that her contribution to the world&rsquo;s work was
making and keeping herself beautiful, and if she had
deceived Doctor Pryne this afternoon into thinking her
serious-minded and idealistic, he was now to be undeceived,
Clare told herself almost gleefully. Watching it
happen was like watching a play, immensely entertaining.
But while Clare watched, she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to be frightened of,&rdquo; she told Petra.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look like that. You don&rsquo;t have to do anything
you don&rsquo;t want to, darling. It is only a suggestion Doctor
Pryne is making. Have a cigarette?&rdquo; She picked one out
of a box on a table at her hand, put it into Petra&rsquo;s fingers,
and finding an automatic lighter, held it for Petra.</p>
<p>Even in his bewilderment at the way Petra had received
his offer, Lewis could appreciate what Clare was
doing in insisting on that cigarette. Petra was a foil for
herself. Physically and temperamentally, all Clare&rsquo;s effects
were heightened by her contrast with her stepdaughter.
And Clare, the artist tireless in procuring her
own effects, took advantage of even so trivial a difference
as smoking and not smoking. She had not remembered
to offer Lewis a cigarette, but she was practically forcing
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
Petra to smoke. And Petra&rsquo;s docile compliance was only
one of the ways in which she was of use to her stepmother
and earned that fantastic two thousand dollars....</p>
<p>But Petra&rsquo;s fingers holding the cigarette were shaking.
The trembling began at her elbow, resting on her knee,
but it was most visible in the fingers. She said, in a voice
that gave the lie to her shaking fingers, &ldquo;It is very nice
of you to offer me a job, Doctor Pryne. How much is
the salary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clare had made a mistake in insisting on the cigarette!
She should have presented Petra with a spear, not an
English Oval, as an emblem of the girl&rsquo;s unyielding
hardihood. The cigarette, moved to exquisite vibrations
in her trembling fingers, merely robbed Petra&rsquo;s overt
hardness of its authenticity. Oh, yes, Clare would do
better to play up the Diana in the girl, not a sophistication
which did not exist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighteen dollars a week,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That is a small
living wage, I know, but I am afraid it is all the job is
really worth. And prices are down. Food, rooms, clothes,
everything. They have tumbled. You ought to be able
to manage on eighteen a week and get quite a lot of fun
out of it, Petra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In saying this so lightly he remembered, of course,
the millions of unemployed throughout the country, and
his heart smote him at his careless words. But he did
not waver in his purpose. Petra&rsquo;s need of employment
was different from theirs, it is true, but no less real. Her
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
situation, as much as theirs, was desperate.... But
what was she saying!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to worry about living on your eighteen
a week, Doctor Pryne. I never could, you know. Just my
dresses cost much more than that. Besides, Clare doesn&rsquo;t
charge me board!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Petra darling! There is nothing in this offer to make
you angry! Doctor Pryne got the idea from you yourself,
this afternoon, that you wanted to leave Green
Doors and be independent. That is why he thought of
this job. He thought you were unhappy because you
weren&rsquo;t independent and living a life of your own. Whatever
did you say to make him think that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petra hesitated. Any one looking at her that moment
could actually see her deciding among a choice of answers
to her stepmother. Lewis did look at her and see. But
Clare could not wait for the fabrication, whatever it was
to be. She went on: &ldquo;But Doctor Pryne has convinced
me of one thing, Petra. He has made me ashamed, not
for you, for myself. Your two thousand dollars&rsquo; allowance
is absurd. With people hungry right in Boston.
When you spend it only for clothes! It ought to be one
thousand, darling. And the other thousand you can give,
yourself, any way you like to do it, to charity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petra&rsquo;s cigarette was burning itself away in an ashtray
between herself and Clare. Its smoke ascended
in thick violet ribbons. Lewis felt that she was thinking
with lightning speed,&mdash;but unguessable thoughts. Clare
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
was as much in the dark as himself as to Petra&rsquo;s thoughts,
he supposed; but he suspected that, unlike himself, she
did not know her own ignorance. Against those ribbons
of violet smoke Petra looked like a sibyl&mdash;enigmatical&mdash;young&mdash;divinely
young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that you are cutting my allowance in
half? Now, like this,&mdash;without warning?&rdquo; She spoke
as if Lewis were not there, as if she and Clare were
alone. Her voice was more astonished than it was angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I wouldn&rsquo;t do that, Petra. You know I wouldn&rsquo;t.
You can still have the second thousand for charity, to
give any way you like. I will do the same myself. I had
been thinking of it for myself as a matter of fact&mdash;even
before my talk with Doctor Pryne about you to-night.
I meant to go over my dress bills and, beginning next
month, budget myself to half as much as I am accustomed
to spend. Merely giving money outright, the way I have
been doing, isn&rsquo;t enough. It is actual sacrifice that
counts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want either to give or to sacrifice,&rdquo; Petra
protested. &ldquo;If the two thousand is mine, I shall spend it
just as I have been spending it the last three years. Is it
mine, or isn&rsquo;t it mine, Clare? That is what I asked you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clare&rsquo;s glance just flickered in Lewis&rsquo; direction. But
she did not want him to read the gratification in it and
she put her hand to her cheek quickly, shading her eyes.
She said, &ldquo;Darling, unless you will look up some charity,
get interested in it, and give the second thousand there,
it can&rsquo;t be yours any more. Not now&mdash;when I have been
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
seeing things through Doctor Pryne&rsquo;s clear vision. But
surely&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis wanted to stop the woman, wanted to undo
all that he himself had so crudely brought about. But
he might as well have tried to push back an oncoming
steam roller as turn Clare from her honorable participation
in this dramatic scene that he himself, no other,
had staged. He felt this and held his peace, knowing all
the while that he had blundered irreparably and made
things worse for Petra than they already had been, in
some mysterious way that he was not yet in a position to
understand.</p>
<p>Petra had interrupted Clare. Her anger had now risen
to the level of her astonishment. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s absolutely unfair,&rdquo;
she cried, her young face and her young voice ablaze
with wrath. &ldquo;It is a <i>salary</i> you are cutting, Clare Otis-Farwell!
Not a mere allowance. Does Doctor Pryne
know that? And you do it casually, like this, at his mere
suggestion. I earn every penny of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in heaven&rsquo;s name do you mean?&rdquo; For that
instant Clare forgot Lewis as audience. Her expression
was simply dumbfounded, with for once nothing subtle
about it. &ldquo;<i>You</i> earn two thousand dollars a year! Why,
you don&rsquo;t even make your own bed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do earn it, all the same. Every dollar of it.
By being around all the while as evidence of your
generosity and goodness! Everybody praises you for it!
And you hope it will make my father keep on adoring
you as he has never kept on adoring his other wives. I am
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
a perpetual reminder to him of how you differ from all
the others. <i>You</i> are <i>maternal</i>!
Haven&rsquo;t I let you play
your part? Haven&rsquo;t I played mine? What have I done
to spoil the picture? Surely you&rsquo;ve thought it worth a
miserable two thousand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clare was on her feet, every tinge of color whipped by
Petra&rsquo;s cruel, wild words from her unrouged face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Petra! Hush! Are you crazy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petra, too, was up. And then Lewis noticed that he
himself was standing! There was nothing he could say
or do, however. He felt as if his own poisonous thoughts
about Clare Farwell had been, through some fault of
his own, broadcast through Petra&rsquo;s sibyllic lips. All the
blame for the whiplash words, for the cruel scorn of
them and their hatred, was his. Not Petra&rsquo;s. It was he,
Lewis, who had thought them and now they were brashly
vocal.</p>
<p>But now suddenly again Petra&rsquo;s voice was her own,
and the words were her own, no sibyl&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Oh, Clare!&rdquo;
she was faltering. &ldquo;I am sorry. I am terribly sorry. I was
crazy, yes.&mdash;&rdquo; And then, looking at Lewis, in a different
and utterly cold tone, she asked surprisingly,
&ldquo;How much does eighteen a week make it a year, Doctor
Pryne? Eighteen times fifty-two, do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He told her, not showing his consternation. She said,
&ldquo;Well, that almost makes up the two thousand, then;
if I live here at Green Doors and Clare pays me one
thousand for part time. Am I to go on living here,
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
Clare? Or isn&rsquo;t that possible&mdash;after what I just said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clare, who was not tall, looked tall at the moment.
Consciousness of a chance to show magnanimity swayed
her bodily as well as mentally, like a refreshing wind,
where only a minute ago she had been stifling. &ldquo;Of course
you may go on living here. This is your home. Of course
you haven&rsquo;t meant a word you said. You were a little
hysterical. It was Doctor Pryne&rsquo;s idea, about your living
in Boston,&mdash;not mine. He even suggested Teresa Kerr
as a roommate! Imagine! But as long as you can tolerate
me, Petra, no matter whether you can ever learn to
trust me and love me or not, I want you <i>at home</i>. Call it
half-time salary if you like. I shall certainly give you the
one thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at mention of Teresa&rsquo;s name, Petra&rsquo;s anger was
back, lashing this time toward Lewis. But only for a
flash. It was over, as lightning is over; and it had struck
through her glance. She answered Clare, turning her
back on Lewis, &ldquo;That <i>is</i> wonderful of you. I don&rsquo;t see
how you can be so forgiving. I don&rsquo;t deserve it. But I
want to tell you, Clare, that ever since I have been with
you here at Green Doors, I have never once spoken a
disloyal word about you&mdash;until this afternoon, to Doctor
Pryne. And I never will again&mdash;not as long as I live
here, and ever after, I hope. Can you ever trust me
again? Do you believe me, Clare?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis turned away. He walked toward one of the
French windows opening onto the terrace. But Petra&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
voice followed him, made him turn again. She was asking
in a polite voice, &ldquo;Is your offer still open, Doctor
Pryne? Shall I come to work on Monday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came back; looked at her for a confused, almost
blank moment; then said shortly, &ldquo;Of course. If you
really want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I can learn? Will I really be any use
to you? It isn&rsquo;t just your conscience giving me that other
thousand, since it&rsquo;s through you I&rsquo;ve lost it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure you will earn every cent of it. Miss Frazier
needs an assistant badly. I told you that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I take this job, Clare? Do you advise it? Do
you believe what Doctor Pryne says? For I won&rsquo;t take
his charity. Will I be worth eighteen a week to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis himself knew that Petra meant would having
a job in Boston hurt the effect Clare desired to obtain
of her relation to her stepdaughter. And did the part-time
job she would now be holding at Green Doors&mdash;that
is, evenings and holidays&mdash;make the one thousand
dollars a guaranteed matter? But what was in Clare&rsquo;s
mind when she answered, Lewis was beyond guessing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should try it, anyway, Petra. Of all people, you
can trust Doctor Pryne&rsquo;s sincerity. Working for him will
be an interesting experience, at the very least, and at
the most you will be having some responsible part in
the world&rsquo;s work and the joy that that inevitably brings.
I think it is very wonderful of Doctor Pryne to take
such an interest&mdash;and help us all. He is very generous&mdash;and
understanding.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;And shall I go back to the hall now? They will be
wondering where I am, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. You must go right back, of course. Darling,
your frock is charming! You do look too lovely to-night.
Tell Dick about your job. He will be particularly interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Petra started to leave, Lewis reached for her hand.
She gave it to him as if in contract. But such a contract!
&ldquo;I shall be on time Monday. Thanks again,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Their eyes were almost on a level, when they stood
together like this, Lewis was so little taller. And Petra&rsquo;s
reticence, a two-edged sword&mdash;and for him now&mdash;was
not merely on guard. It cut down between them, severing
all understanding.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<h2 id="c9"><i>Chapter Nine</i></h2><div class="img"><img src="images/ch.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="30" /></div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought we were all right. There aren&rsquo;t any
loose ends that I know of....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis had come to his office half an hour ahead of
his usual time on Monday morning in order to prepare
his secretary for Petra&rsquo;s appearance there, which would
be due, if she kept her word, a few minutes later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly there are no loose ends. But that is just
the trouble. You are so conscientious that you won&rsquo;t let
the sun go down&mdash;no, you won&rsquo;t let it rise, and that
is the point&mdash;on loose ends. You sit up nights over the
work. I simply had to get you an assistant and this
seemed the opportunity. By the way, and it&rsquo;s very
much by the way, did you do what I said and forget
the manuscript over the week-end, or did you keep it
right by you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Frazier did not bother to answer. It was a
foolish question. How could she have done what he
wanted! His book was going to press in another month.
At least, she and the publishers intended that it should.
Naturally, she had worked on it over Saturday and
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
Sunday, and she would continue to do that, if only
Doctor Pryne kept his end up, until the thing was in
print. But now she would not waste time in defending
her industry, with this new girl due any minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; Miss Frazier asked. &ldquo;Where did you
find her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Petra Farwell. She needed a job so badly that
I offered her this one without considering very much
her qualifications.&rdquo; He had to admit it. &ldquo;She has no
training but I believe she can typewrite a little. She
has done some copying for her father. But whether she
can spell or knows how to make out a check, or anything
of the sort, I don&rsquo;t know. I thought we&rsquo;d put her
in the reception office with the telephone and the
patients. She has a nice clear voice and nice manners.
That will relieve you of the part you like least. Isn&rsquo;t
it so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petra Farwell! That was the girl, the daughter of
the novelist Lowell Farwell, about whom they had
been speaking here in the office only a few days ago. A
young architect, a Mr. Richard Wilder, had made an
appointment for the sole purpose of asking Doctor
Pryne to psychoanalyze the novelist&rsquo;s daughter, and he
had taken fifteen minutes or more of Doctor Pryne&rsquo;s
time doing it. It was with some satisfaction Miss
Frazier had already made a memorandum of the bill
she was to send for that interview and obtained the
doctor&rsquo;s approval of it,&mdash;twenty-five dollars. Doctor
Pryne had turned down the case, naturally, since he
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
was not a psychoanalyst, and really, anyway, had time
for only serious work; but Miss Frazier remembered
that he had accepted an invitation to tea at the Farwell
home in the country. And this was the result!</p>
<p>Miss Farwell had not sounded a very attractive person.
And why should she, the daughter of Lowell Farwell
and the stepdaughter of a very rich woman, need
a job so badly that Doctor Pryne had engaged her
without consulting his secretary, or assuring himself of
her qualifications?</p>
<p>But Miss Frazier pulled herself up at this point in
her reflections. She had no business letting herself remember
anything that had been said about Miss Farwell
in a professional fifteen minutes here in the doctor&rsquo;s
sanctum. Her standard for herself was to approximate
her employer&rsquo;s professional attitude as closely as possible&mdash;one
part of the mind for confidences given professionally,
and the other, quite separated and even
uncolored by that special knowledge, for the social
contact. So at this moment she did not show by so much
as a lifted eyebrow that she had any intimate knowledge
whatever of Miss Farwell&rsquo;s character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve promised her,&rdquo; the doctor was saying,
&ldquo;that between times, when there&rsquo;s nothing in particular
to do for you, she can study shorthand and practice
typing. Please order the best textbooks for that, will
you, Miss Frazier, this morning,&mdash;and a machine.
Rent or buy the machine, whichever is more economical.
And she will have to have a table for it in the reception
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
office. You can get that while you are out at lunch.&mdash;After
she gets going, she might take on some of the
book. As I said, she has done copying for her father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The expression with which his secretary received this
last remark, however, showed Lewis his stupid mistake.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just talking through my hat,&rdquo; he said quickly.
&ldquo;That is a hopeless idea, of course. But can you tell me
how it is that you appear to be the only known human
living who can make out my stuff, Miss Frazier?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl averted her face. Her clear-cut, almost
cameo profile kept its accustomed impersonal secretarial
look, but her cheek was hot. Lewis saw the unaccustomed
color and was annoyed with himself for his second
stupidity in the minute.</p>
<p>She said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sixth sense I have about your writing,
I guess. It almost seems so, anyway. I am not so
extraordinarily good about all illegible handwriting.
But even the first day, yours was pretty clear to me. It
surprises me myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that is the best of luck for me,&rdquo; Lewis murmured,
and was grateful to hear a door opening and
a step out in the reception office. &ldquo;That must be Petra,&rdquo;
he exclaimed, and went out quickly.</p>
<p>He brought her in. But Miss Frazier, at the moment
of Petra&rsquo;s entrance, was blind to Petra&rsquo;s bodily reality.
It was rather the reflection of her on the doctor&rsquo;s face
that Miss Frazier saw and read as easily as she was
accustomed to read his illegible script. &ldquo;It has happened
at last,&rdquo; the thought sliced through her brain,
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
clean, knifelike. And then, flowing through and over
the wound, came the tides of her will, cooling the painful
gash. &ldquo;Nobody must guess that it matters.... It
doesn&rsquo;t matter.... It can&rsquo;t matter....&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was will, too, that jerked her attention from the
doctor&rsquo;s mirroring face, after that first second, to the
girl herself. There she stood in a cool white frock with
a violet-colored felt hat slouched Greta Garbo fashion
over bright curls. She looked frightened. Why should
she be frightened?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Frazier will initiate you,&rdquo; the doctor&rsquo;s voice
was blurred and as far away as his face, washed over by
the tides of Miss Frazier&rsquo;s brave will. &ldquo;You must ask
her anything you need to know as it comes up, Petra.
That is the simplest way, I suppose, to learn the ropes.
And now I had better have a look at the mail.&rdquo;&mdash;It
was there, already sorted for him into piles on his desk,
with Miss Frazier&rsquo;s accustomed clarifying notes attached.</p>
<p>Miss Frazier took Petra, first, to the dressing room
which now they must share. &ldquo;This door goes into my
private office,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;and this into the reception
room, which will be in your charge. I&rsquo;ll clear all
my personal things out of the desk at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she had taken off her hat and powdered her
face, Petra followed the secretary to the desk which was
to be, miraculously, her very own, and they stood looking
down on it together&mdash;both of them inarticulate and
at a loss. &ldquo;Perhaps the best way will be for you merely
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
to stick around and notice how I answer the telephone
to-day,&rdquo; Miss Frazier decided, after a minute of cogitation.
&ldquo;One of your jobs, when you have caught on, will
be to take down the names and addresses of the new
patients, and file them here in this card drawer. Do you
see? Whether the doctor accepts them as patients or
not, we want the names and addresses, and the date that
they telephoned or came. That is the only recording you
will do out here. The rest I attend to, and it all goes
into the files in the inner office. The most difficult thing
to learn will be which calls to pass on to the doctor,
though. I don&rsquo;t myself quite see how he thinks you
are going to begin learning that....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Doctor Pryne, with his door shut, stood
looking down at his desk, but not touching the letters.
He intended to take Petra out to lunch with him in a
few hours and explain to her&mdash;although he could never
do that really, since he didn&rsquo;t understand it himself&mdash;how
he had ever been so stupidly forgetful as to mention
Teresa&rsquo;s name to Clare, after Petra&rsquo;s warning him
not to. Petra would forgive him. She must, of course.
And then she would finish about Teresa. Or perhaps
Teresa Kerr was living in Boston and would be in at the
office this very day to see Petra. Or perhaps Petra would
take him to see Teresa. In any case, Lewis&rsquo; interest in
Teresa had increased, almost unreasonably, since Petra
had broken off telling him about her, Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>Now, in another second, he must start in on the day&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
work, beginning with the top letter on the right-hand
pile&mdash;the pile Miss Frazier had marked <i>immediate</i>.
And when he did start in, he must put Petra out of his
mind,&mdash;luncheon plans, interrupted confidences, and
all. If he was <i>not</i> capable of putting Petra clean out of his
mind and keeping her there for hours at a stretch, then
the situation he had got himself into would be absurd
and impossible. But he had offered her the job of his
own impulse, and the fact that she had accepted it in a
totally different spirit from what he had expected, had
nothing to do with her right to keep it. It was hers, of
course, just as long as she wanted it, although her reason
for wanting it had become a mystery to him. So,
he must&mdash;in half a second&mdash;clear his consciousness of
her there just a few feet beyond his closed door&mdash;clear
it clean as a whistle.</p>
<p>But as he prepared to make the effort, the telephone
buzzed at his elbow. Petra&rsquo;s voice came to him, clear,
clipped, but a trifle unsteady. &ldquo;Mrs. Joseph Duffield is
calling you from New York, Doctor. Shall I put her
through?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis mentally congratulated his secretary. She had
got Petra started already. That was fine. It was Miss
Frazier who had decided, of course, that this call was
one he would certainly want to take, and now she was
showing Petra how to put it through to him. But he
foresaw the time, soon, when Petra, if she really was
going to save Miss Frazier and be of use to her, must
be left to discriminate for herself, and that was going
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
to mean many mistakes. He frowned, rather, realizing
that eventuality, as he said, &ldquo;Yes, thanks. I&rsquo;ll take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Duffield&rsquo;s first words, however, put everything
else in the world out of Lewis&rsquo; mind. His fingers gripped
the bar of the instrument and he listened with a graying
face. Yet, when his turn came to speak, his voice
was full of confidence, even buoyant. &ldquo;You have the
very best man. Doctor Stephens is an authority. That
gives Michael every human chance possible. You did
just the right thing. Tell Michael I am catching the first
express and will be there in a few hours. My dear, don&rsquo;t
cry....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He set down the instrument with soft precision then,
on the sounds of a woman&rsquo;s sobs. The next instant he was
out in his reception office, his hat jammed under one
arm, thrusting his letters into the two pockets of his
coat, and looking for Miss Frazier. Petra had no
existence for him now. She had been wiped from his consciousness
by the bitter news he had just received, without
need of a struggle after all. Miss Frazier got up from
the chair she had drawn close to Petra&rsquo;s while she taught
her the use of the telephone switchboard, ready for his
demands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m catching the New York Express. Michael Duffield&rsquo;s
got infantile paralysis. He wants me. Stephens is
on the case. That gives the kid every chance. I&rsquo;ll call
you up to-night if there&rsquo;s anything to tell. Doctor Cotsworth
will have to take the clinic to-morrow. Give him
the dope on the Pettis case pretty carefully. It&rsquo;s in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
file. Tell Doctor Hagar I&rsquo;ll call him long distance at
four this afternoon and to stay in for it. He&rsquo;ll have to
handle that Arlington business without me. Put the
private patients off by telephone. But you&rsquo;ll have to
send a message to McCloud, of course. Give him an appointment
for Saturday afternoon. The others will have
to wait for appointments till we know when I&rsquo;ll be back.
But before you do anything get in touch with the hospital&mdash;&rdquo;
But he broke off. &ldquo;This is nonsense. There
isn&rsquo;t time. Grab your hat, bring your book. We&rsquo;ll finish
in the taxi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He remembered the new assistant then and commanded,
&ldquo;Petra, get us a taxi and tell them it&rsquo;s rush.
Give her the number, Miss Frazier. I&rsquo;ll get the elevator
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Frazier followed the doctor out, not bothering
about her hat, but her shorthand pad and her fountain
pen were clutched in her hand, and she even had the
presence of mind to snatch a pencil from Petra&rsquo;s desk
in case the pen ran dry. Petra got the promise from the
taxi company that the car would be at the door in a minute
and then went through to the doctor&rsquo;s office to see
whether they actually managed it. To her utter relief, a
taxi drew up at the curb just as the doctor and Miss
Frazier came out to it. Petra was exhilarated. So far,
then, she was a success at this job. There had been no
slip. She had been efficient.</p>
<p>Petra had worries enough&mdash;even anguish of a sort&mdash;to
keep her from being radiantly happy over having a
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
job. Yet it was a dream come true. A year ago, why, even
this spring, she <i>would</i> have been radiantly happy. But
then it needn&rsquo;t have been a double job; she needn&rsquo;t have
lived at Green Doors and done the stepdaughter act
evenings and holidays. She would have gone to stay
with Teresa and they would really have lived. Such
freedom, such self-respect, and happiness as would have
been hers then! That was the way she had planned it,
exhilarated by the very imagining. And now&mdash;how
different&mdash;.</p>
<p>But suddenly Petra forgot brilliant might-have-beens,
for her telephone was ringing! She flew. She slipped
into her chair, knees under the desk, her spine very
straight and businesslike, her eyes grave and listening.&mdash;&ldquo;This
is Doctor Pryne&rsquo;s office.&rdquo;&mdash;And whoever was at
the other end of the wire must have known from the
pure and winged quality of her voice that the person
answering Doctor Pryne&rsquo;s telephone was young, beautiful,
and very much on the job.</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Ordinarily you and I must not tell each other, or
discuss, things that come up in Doctor Pryne&rsquo;s work,&mdash;not
in terms of personalities, anyway. But Michael, of
course, is different. He isn&rsquo;t a &lsquo;case.&rsquo; It is almost as if a
child of Doctor Pryne&rsquo;s had infantile paralysis. Why, it
isn&rsquo;t even almost. It is just the same, really. That&rsquo;s why
I&rsquo;ve told you about Michael. It would be inhuman for
you not to know, when Doctor Pryne returns, whether
the boy is lost or saved&mdash;how he is feeling about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>The two girls were talking in Miss Frazier&rsquo;s private
office at the end of Petra&rsquo;s first day. Petra had her Greta
Garbo hat jammed down over her bright curls, ready to
drive out to Green Doors with Dick Wilder, whose car
was waiting down on Marlboro Street. She had just
looked down from Miss Frazier&rsquo;s window and seen it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so grateful you did tell me,&rdquo; she assured the
secretary. &ldquo;And I am going to ask something. Would
you call me up at Meadowbrook to-night&mdash;reversed
charges&mdash;if you hear anything from New York? It&rsquo;s as
if I knew Michael himself now&mdash;from your telling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two years ago, Michael&rsquo;s grandmother had been
brought to Doctor Pryne&rsquo;s clinic. This was what Miss
Frazier had just told Petra. The old lady was insane
and had to be placed in an asylum. Trailing along with
the neighbors who had taken it upon themselves to bring
the poor creature to the clinic was the boy, Michael, aged
nine, who now, without his grandmother, was alone and
would also become a charge of the State. But Doctor
Pryne had taken Michael home with him that night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He brought him into the office the next morning,&rdquo;
Miss Frazier had told Petra. &ldquo;He actually wanted to
adopt the kid himself. He was a most interesting and
lovable little fellow really; but what the doctor could
have done with him if he had kept him I cannot imagine.
He lives in an apartment hotel because he does not want
to bother with a housekeeper. Adopting Michael would
have meant a housekeeper, of course, and a real home.
But that wasn&rsquo;t what made Doctor Pryne give up the
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
idea in the end. He would have created a home for that
child, given up all his freedom to do it, I am sure, if
Michael hadn&rsquo;t been a Catholic. That made Doctor
Pryne feel that he ought to have a Catholic upbringing.
It would be the child&rsquo;s best chance, Doctor Pryne was
sure, for living down the frightful memories of his
grandmother&rsquo;s slowly developing insanity. Only continuity
in the child&rsquo;s religious life could carry him on
over the break which had come so tragically in his family
life. Little Michael had adored his old grandmother
and she had been everything to him until her reason
began to go. Then she had commenced beating him and
imagining he had done things he had never thought of
doing. It was horrible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor Pryne kept Michael a month or more, trying
to decide what to do with him. But he was always
worried, wondering what he was up to in the hours between
school and the end of work here, when they could
be together. Then Doctor Pryne remembered his
friend, Mrs. Duffield. She&rsquo;s a Catholic, a widow with
seven children, and a close friend of Doctor Pryne&rsquo;s. She
is extraordinarily beautiful-looking and that had something
to do with the doctor&rsquo;s choosing her. No, I mean
it. It did! Michael was so sensitive to beauty and he had
had so little of it! Doctor Pryne thinks he has genius. I
can&rsquo;t see myself that Michael&rsquo;s drawings are remarkable
but the doctor says they are. Anyway, when he remembered
how beautiful she was, and that she was a Catholic,
he took Michael right to New York and persuaded Mrs.
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
Duffield to adopt him. She did it&mdash;over night, practically.
He would be her eighth child and they are all
boys, but she was delighted all the same, after she had
had him there for an hour. Pretty lucky she has so much
money and didn&rsquo;t have to think about that! Doctor
Pryne goes to New York to &lsquo;play&rsquo; with them every few
months. They all do wonderful things together,&mdash;music,
riding in the park, even sea trips. When he comes back
from New York he looks almost as if he&rsquo;d had a year&rsquo;s
vacation. He&rsquo;s devoted to the whole Duffield family, but
Michael is the apple of his eye. It&rsquo;s picturesque, isn&rsquo;t it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petra had thought about it, her eyes on Miss Frazier&rsquo;s
pale face. The day had been hot even for June and Miss
Frazier had been typing for dear life. Petra had heard
her machine going madly hour after hour, in here,
through the closed door. That might account for the
pallor, but Petra thought not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> picturesque,&rdquo; she agreed thoughtfully. &ldquo;I hope,
for your sake as well as Doctor Pryne&rsquo;s and Michael&rsquo;s,
that&mdash;that it turns out all right. I hadn&rsquo;t been realizing&mdash;hadn&rsquo;t
taken in&mdash;how anxious you have been all day.
I was thinking only of myself, I guess. I thought it was
I, that I was to blame,&mdash;that you didn&rsquo;t really like
my being here. I am sorry now I was so blind and&mdash;and
egotistical. It was Michael all the time that made
you so silent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Frazier had leaned back in her chair at this point
and lifted her eyes to her new assistant&rsquo;s. Before she
looked away from that earnest young face, she knew
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
that she could never resent this girl. It was no longer a
case of willing. She said to herself in surprise, &ldquo;She is
kind and strangely gentle. She&rsquo;s a dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petra&rsquo;s thought of Miss Frazier in that meeting of
their glances had been as sure and swift as Miss Frazier&rsquo;s
of her. Dick Wilder, when Petra had returned to her
party, Saturday night, to have the next dance with him,
had said that Doctor Pryne&rsquo;s secretary was ridiculously
starchy and self-important. He had quite frightened
Petra of her.&mdash;Well, he had been wrong. Miss Frazier
was a simply grand person. Her grandness was there in
the very curve of her eyelashes and the line of her nose.</p>
<p>Now Miss Frazier was promising: &ldquo;Yes, when the
doctor calls me to-night, I&rsquo;ll call you. I have a hunch it
will be good news, since they got Doctor Stephens onto
it so promptly. He&rsquo;s the last word on infantile paralysis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Impulsively Petra came nearer the desk. &ldquo;Miss
Frazier,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have a friend I would love you to
know. And she you. May I take you to see her some
time? She is my best friend. We have been friends for
years. She has studied to be a private secretary. I think
you will like knowing each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petra in that moment had no thought of making a
friend for herself of Miss Frazier. What had she to
offer this clear-cut, high-salaried, dependable person!
But Teresa had everything to give her. Teresa and Miss
Frazier must know each other. That they would be
friends seemed inevitable.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s kind and strangely gentle. She&rsquo;s a dear....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>She&rsquo;s a simply grand person. Good enough to know
Teresa....</p>
<p>Friendship is as independent of time as is Eternity. It
may require years to arrive, or it may be there, how and
why unknown, as if it had always existed, at the trembling
of a leaf. Miss Frazier and Teresa were bound to
be friends, sooner or later. But to her complete astonishment,
as Petra hurried belatedly down to join Dick in
his car, she realized that she and Miss Frazier were
friends already.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<h2 id="c10"><i>Chapter Ten</i></h2><div class="img"><img src="images/ch.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="30" /></div>
<p>Cynthia Allen was sitting at her dressing table
giving her make-up its final touches for dinner and the
evening and chatting in the direction of her husband,
who was over on the window seat skimming the <i>Transcript</i>.
The real reading would come later, after dinner,
with the radio for accompaniment. But in spite of Harry&rsquo;s
being directly in the open window, and silent while
Cynthia was vocal, it was she, not he, who knew that a
car had turned in at their driveway, and ran, lipstick in
hand, to kneel beside him and see who it was. For
Cynthia, like most adults, if they told the truth about
it, felt that every sound of a car&rsquo;s brakes, every ring of a
bell, every knock, might be a possible harbinger of
Destiny.</p>
<p>In the present instance, however, there was no grinding
of brakes where the Allens&rsquo; driveway met the highway,
for Lewis&rsquo; glittering, long-bodied roadster was
very nearly silent in all its ways. What Cynthia had
heard was merely the spurt of gravel between her gates.
&ldquo;If only Lewis would live up to his car!&rdquo; she often
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
sighed to herself. &ldquo;If he would have an important-looking
office and good-looking tailored clothes!&rdquo; But
she supposed that the car was a tool in his work and that
was why he allowed himself always the latest and most
expensive model.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Lewis,&rdquo; she told Harry, who had not so much as
turned his head. Harry&rsquo;s apparent indifference did not
deceive his wife, however, nor irritate her. She imagined
him every bit as sensitive as herself to the possibilities
attending the unexpected; putting off the moment of
knowing merely prolonged his agreeable suspense. &ldquo;But
Lewis is a thoughtless beast,&rdquo; she said aloud. &ldquo;He might
have called up. Nellie will be frantic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she pushed up the screen and leaned over the
sill. Her brother had seen her and stopped under the
window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go right around to the kitchen,&rdquo; she whispered
down, her hands funneling her lips. &ldquo;Tell Nellie that I
didn&rsquo;t invite you or dream you were coming, that you&rsquo;re
not company, and she&rsquo;s not to do the least bit of fussing
for you. I wouldn&rsquo;t go near her on a bet, myself, but
you, with your wide experience, may know how to handle
a maddened woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Lewis had started on, she leaned from the
window again and called down in her natural voice,
&ldquo;Harry says we&rsquo;re delighted you&rsquo;ve come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A minute later her eyes met her husband&rsquo;s in the
mirror of her dressing table. Her own were worried and
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
Harry was curious about it. She answered his silent
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harry! I don&rsquo;t like it. I don&rsquo;t like it a bit. I&rsquo;m&mdash;deeply
troubled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear! You blessed idiot! I thought it was merely
your idea of being funny. What has happened to your
sense of humor? If Nellie doesn&rsquo;t like it, she can lump
it. What&rsquo;s it to us! She isn&rsquo;t such a hot cook, anyway.
Besides&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Cynthia was laughing. &ldquo;Blessed idiot yourself!&rdquo;
she crowed, but went on quickly serious again. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t
Nellie; it&rsquo;s Lewis I mind! See here! This is Thursday,
isn&rsquo;t it? Lewis was here over the week-end and now he&rsquo;s
back again. Twice in one week. Why, do you suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Harry had no idea. Certainly it was unprecedented.
And Cynthia went on. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you.
Lewis has come to see his new stenographer. Being with
her all day in town&mdash;having Petra right there in his
office from nine to four every single day in the week&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
enough. He has to come shooting twenty miles out
to Green Doors to spend the evening with her. He&rsquo;s a
lost soul, I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this isn&rsquo;t Green Doors! This is my house. He
has come to see me and the kids&mdash;perhaps even you. If
he wanted to be with Petra Farwell, he could take her
out to dinner in town or to the Country Club. Just the
two of &rsquo;em. No need to go all around Robin Hood&rsquo;s
barn to get at her. But even if Petra lived here and he
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
had come to see her&mdash;what of it? What&rsquo;s the matter
with Petra? Why shouldn&rsquo;t Lewis be left to choose his
own girl? Why need you fasten such an expression onto
a perfectly good face over it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cynthia looked deeply into her mirror, curious to see
what the expression was. She answered amiably, &ldquo;Lewis
must choose for himself, of course. But I have a right to
my concern, haven&rsquo;t I? He isn&rsquo;t seriously in love with
Petra. He couldn&rsquo;t be. It&rsquo;s merely her youth and
beauty.... I&rsquo;m sure of it.... Mere physical attraction!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry got up and started for the door. He had business
with the cocktails and also he must welcome his
brother-in-law. But he turned back, for a minute. &ldquo;<i>Mere
youth and beauty? Mere physical attraction?</i> You might
as well say &lsquo;mere dynamite&rsquo; and have done with it,&rdquo; he
said seriously. &ldquo;You and your meres! You&rsquo;re an idiot....
We are happily married. Ten years happy. Who
are you to be babbling like some old maid of &lsquo;mere physical
attraction.&rsquo; Mere lightning&mdash;and you know it! Look
here! If they are really that way about each other&mdash;well,
let&rsquo;s hope they&rsquo;ll be happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harry, you can&rsquo;t make me mad. I know you&rsquo;re an
idealist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I? Perhaps. But I&rsquo;m not a sentimentalist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you say &lsquo;mere physical attraction&rsquo; you are. A
woman who has been a lover herself for ten years! It&rsquo;s
mawkish and insincere.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you and I are intellectually congenial, Harry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t when we married. We&rsquo;ve developed
along the same lines since, that&rsquo;s all. But it was passion
that melted us up and made our mental and spiritual
amalgamation a reality. We only thought we were congenial,
those early days, because we wanted each other
so desperately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Cynthia said quickly, &ldquo;it
mightn&rsquo;t turn out with Lewis and Petra as it has with
us. I don&rsquo;t see how it could. She&rsquo;s so shallow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course nobody knows how it will turn out ever.
But if they&rsquo;re drawn to each other by mere&mdash;mere&mdash;what
was it you said they were drawn by? I don&rsquo;t remember&mdash;but
what you meant was mere cosmic forces&mdash;I
guess you&rsquo;ll have to let that attraction take its
course, and remain a mere sister who hasn&rsquo;t a thing to
say. Sorry, darling. But you annoy me, rather.&rdquo; He
kissed her, all the same, as if that was what he had come
back for.</p>
<p>Cynthia had guessed right. Lewis was really headed
for Green Doors, intending only to dine with the
Allens en route. He told Cynthia and Harry about his
summons to New York and gave them a dramatic account
of the latest methods in the treatment of infantile
paralysis, but he was careful to wait until the children
were safely out of earshot. Little Michael Duffield was
going to get well and the probability was that he would
suffer no permanent disability from his terrible experience.
The other Duffield children had been packed off
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
to the shore in charge of tutors and with a trained nurse
to watch for symptoms. They had gone off in two large
cars and were living in an isolated cottage to meet all
the requirements of quarantine. But Mrs. Duffield herself
was staying with her adopted boy and would not
join the others until he was well enough to be taken
with her, unless one of her own children developed the
disease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is almost no limit to what modern science can
do, with wealth to back it up,&rdquo; Cynthia commented.</p>
<p>But Lewis met this with silence. He had just been
through a twenty-four-hour agonizing suspense, when
all that science had to give, and all that wealth could
buy, and even all that love could plead, had waited on&mdash;a
Mystery. And the Mystery, over and over, during
those dread hours, had been named by Mrs. Duffield,
&ldquo;God&rsquo;s Will.&rdquo; Lewis&rsquo; face was strained and his eyes still
heavy from watching.</p>
<p>The Allens were a little embarrassed by the way
Lewis had taken the business; but they were touched as
well. They knew how peculiarly devoted to this little
Michael he was. Cynthia was glad, indeed, that she herself
had not known that the boy was so ill all these past
days, and Lewis with him. That would have worried
her for her brother&rsquo;s sake infinitely more than this
Petra business was worrying her. Petra fears, in fact,
had dwindled, in the face of all that Lewis had just told
them, into mere goblin phantoms.</p>
<p>But even so she remarked, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny, but do you
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
know, I don&rsquo;t believe Clare knows you&rsquo;ve been away
any more than we did. Petra couldn&rsquo;t have told them.
And what&rsquo;s still more inexplicable, Petra has gotten
home late every evening and hardly has time to dress
for dinner. Clare rather implied that you were overworking
her, keeping her such unconscionable hours!
And all the time you haven&rsquo;t been there at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis&rsquo; eyelids just flickered but he gave no other
sign. He had told Miss Frazier by telephone this morning
that he would take an afternoon train and be at the
office at the usual time to-morrow morning. But Mrs.
Duffield had persuaded him to fly instead, and that
swift and luxurious way of travel had brought him to
Boston late this afternoon. He had dropped around at
the office and found Miss Frazier still there. She had
sent Petra home early, she said, because of the heat;
and the other afternoons she had let Petra catch the
three-forty express for Meadowbrook, thinking there
was so little need for two of them with the doctor away.&mdash;What
was the mystery? Why need Petra be so
devious, Lewis asked himself. But he was glad he had
been warned. Very glad. He might so easily have betrayed
her to-night, later, at Green Doors.</p>
<p>It was dark when Lewis drove up the Green Doors
road and recognized Dick&rsquo;s car standing before the door.
He was taken to the library, after having sent in his
name and been left waiting a minute or two in the hall.
The maid who had admitted him had seemed none too
sure that any one was at home. He realized the reason
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
for her caution when he saw what his visit was interrupting.
Lowell Farwell was reading aloud from his
own manuscript. Clare was picturesquely erect in a corner
of the divan, working on a brilliant square of needlepoint.
Dick lounged and smoked a briar pipe beside
her, looking rather romantic, young and very handsome.
The author himself sat facing them, his hands
full of canary-colored scratch paper.&mdash;Lewis was, had
he known it, the sole person who would have been
allowed to interrupt the reading.</p>
<p>He was welcomed warmly. Clare&rsquo;s inward smile indeed
was as brilliant, as warm, as that on her lips and
in her eyes. So soon! She had given Doctor Pryne two
or three weeks before he would allow himself to return&mdash;and
here he was back within the week! Doctor Lewis
Pryne! The inaccessible! The unobtainable! It was
more than gratifying. It was&mdash;exciting and delightful....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad Petra isn&rsquo;t at home,&rdquo; she said at once. &ldquo;She
won&rsquo;t like missing you. But she said there was extra work
to-night and she would have supper somewhere with
Miss Frazier and then get back to it. I thought you must
be there in person, cracking the slave whip, Doctor.
Awfully nice to have you here instead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time, because he was prepared, Lewis did not so
much as blink. &ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t necessary for me to stay.
But I am interrupting. You shouldn&rsquo;t have been &lsquo;at
home.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lowell Farwell was putting away the manuscript.
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
&ldquo;Nothing of the kind,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I can read to
Clare any time. Dick came to play with Petra and I did
the ancient mariner turn with him; so <i>he</i> won&rsquo;t mind
my stopping. It isn&rsquo;t every day I get a chance to talk
with a genuine psychologist. If I hadn&rsquo;t gone in for writing,
Doctor Pryne, I should be in your field. Do you,
by the way, read Dostoevsky? The Russians know a
thing or two. They aren&rsquo;t afraid of turning to the findings
of morbid psychology for suggestion, at least, in
their studies of human character....&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was sometime after ten when Petra let herself
softly in at the front door. The library door had been
left open after Lewis&rsquo; interruption of the reading and
she heard voices. Dick&rsquo;s. Her father&rsquo;s. If Lewis had happened
to speak as she crossed the hall, she would never
have gone on and in. She would have stolen away to
bed and sent a maid to tell Clare she was at home. It
was too late to retreat when she saw Lewis. Her face
hardened as she came forward. So Clare had won. They
had not known at the office&mdash;she and Miss Frazier&mdash;that
Doctor Pryne had even returned, and yet here he
was the first hour he was back, sitting beside her stepmother,
helping her wind up a ball of yarn. But it was
stupid to be so surprised. Hadn&rsquo;t she known ever since
Saturday evening that Clare had Doctor Pryne in tow!
If it were not so, he would never have betrayed Petra&rsquo;s
confidences to her as he had done.</p>
<p>Clare entranced every one, of course,&mdash;except Petra
herself. But Saturday afternoon, when Doctor Pryne
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
had walked with Petra across to the guest-house piazza
and sat there, listening to the bobolink, and Petra had
been moved to be herself with him, and even to talk
about Teresa, she had thought that Doctor Pryne would
be the one exception to the general rule. He would be
her friend&mdash;Petra&rsquo;s&mdash;not Clare&rsquo;s. <i>He would see
through Clare.</i> He belonged to herself and Teresa. That
meeting, long ago in the Cambridge apartment, had
made him belong. Or rather they had been deceived&mdash;and
thought so. Where had the idea come from, anyway?
Teresa had been as illusioned as Petra herself.
And when he held her chair for her at Clare&rsquo;s tea table&mdash;and
even more, while she sat silent beside him, and
could not make herself eat or drink because it was so
wonderful that he had come at last&mdash;Petra had <i>known</i>
that he understood her and was close to her in some indefinable
but real way. She had known but she had
known a lie. It was an illusion brought away out of
childhood; and she had been enticed from her secret
fastness by it, the fastness where she hid from Clare
and all of the life here at Green Doors.</p>
<p>Doctor Pryne was holding a chair for her at this minute
as he had held the chair under the elm. The same
look was on his face. If she did not watch out, she would
be betrayed by it into sincerity again, into being simply
herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darling! You should have called up from the station.
I&rsquo;d have sent a car for you. I suppose you came in a
taxi. I didn&rsquo;t hear it. I was beginning to worry, really.
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
Here&rsquo;s Elise with punch. You&rsquo;re just in time, Elise. We
are famished. Petra, you do look tired. Pass them to
Miss Farwell first, Elise. Darling, you don&rsquo;t look tired,
you look <i>exhausted</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clare was justified in the observation. Petra&rsquo;s face was
shadowed by obvious weariness, and Lewis thought that
her long, sun-burned fingers held the stem of her goblet
of punch with a counterfeit steadiness. Sheer will was
keeping her steady&mdash;and hard. He was certain of it.</p>
<p>Lewis himself did not sit down again. He said that he
must go. It would be midnight as it was when he got to
his rooms, and work would be piled sky-high to-morrow
after his absence. But he did not say this. They were not
to know that he had been away and not seen his office
for several days, since Petra had not told them. And if
the child was fearful that he had already explained that
he had never kept her working over hours, he would
relieve her mind at once. But how?</p>
<p>He said, as casually as he could, &ldquo;No need to be on
time to-morrow, Petra. Mrs. Farwell thinks I&rsquo;m a
slave driver and it will be true unless we call a halt.
After this, your hours are to be from nine till four, as
we first agreed, and an hour out for lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petra was quick to understand. So they <i>had</i> told him!
He knew about her lies! But he had not given her away
and was not doing so now. That was strange. Why? And
it seemed almost as if he were promising her, indirectly,
that he had no intention of giving her away at all. At
the same time, he was laying a command on her: she
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
must not use this particular excuse ever again to gain
her private ends, whatever they were. Oh, yes, Petra
thought she understood, and humiliation drowned what
might have been gratitude.</p>
<p>As for Lewis, he had never known that young eyes
could hold such dumb, repressed misery as he saw in
those that Petra slowly raised to his own, when she returned
his formal &ldquo;good night&rdquo; with one more formal.
But he had only meant to reassure her. Did she think
he was taunting or judging? It was intolerable that she
should have any such idea. It was intolerable that he
should have wounded her and that he could not explain
himself to her to-night, before she slept. But could he
explain himself to her to-morrow? Could he explain
himself to himself, if it came to that? Did he know why
he was not appalled by this girl&rsquo;s deceit and why he was
not angry with her for having put him in an unfair position
by her lies? If he had only been self-disciplined
enough, sensible enough, to have waited until morning
to see Petra! Now the night was going to be much
longer than it would have been had he never come out
here at all. And he had thought to have shortened it by
coming!</p>
<p>Lowell Farwell accompanied Lewis out to the street
door, insisting again, as they crossed the spaces of the
great hall, that he would never know all about morbid
psychology until he had made a thorough study of the
Russian novelist, Dostoevsky,&mdash;and, possibly, a few
other even more modern writers of psychological novels.
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
For your novelist knew intuitively what your psychologist
only came at through experiment, and he knew it
first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, read the great novelists,&rdquo; Farwell advised
Lewis, with an almost passionate insistence. &ldquo;Read
Thomas Mann. Read Hardy. And above all read
Dostoevsky. Then you might even read some Americans.
There are one&mdash;or two&mdash;you know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis got away quickly without admitting the fact
that he knew his Dostoevsky practically by heart. Somehow,
he hoped he would never have to hear Farwell
patronizing that master or comparing his novels to his
own, even by implication. Lewis wanted not to detest
Petra&rsquo;s father.</p>

<h2 id="c11"><i>Chapter Eleven</i></h2><div class="img"><img src="images/ch.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="30" /></div>
<p>Miss Frazier put a list of Friday&rsquo;s appointments
on Petra&rsquo;s desk. &ldquo;This is going to be a crowded day,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Here they are. The doctor won&rsquo;t be able to
see anybody who&rsquo;s not down here, unless it is something
very special, and you&rsquo;ll have to decide that. Of course,
they&rsquo;ll all say it is very special. You&rsquo;ll have to judge in
spite of what they say. If you get puzzled, just tell them
to telephone again later, or, if it&rsquo;s somebody calling,
keep them until I come out and you can ask me about it.
But I think you won&rsquo;t have to do either of those things.
I think you&rsquo;ll be perfectly able to decide anything that
comes up for yourself, Petra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Janet!&rdquo; They were Petra and Janet to each
other&mdash;had been since the second day. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re throwing
me in and telling me to swim. Suppose I make a mistake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that will be just too bad!&rdquo; But Janet belied
the slangy irony of the words by a quizzical accompanying
smile. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the way I myself began,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And
after all, you have had several days now of answering
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
telephones and talking to people here, with me right
beside you. I never had any such start. Don&rsquo;t worry.
Just dive in. You&rsquo;ll be all right. I know it.&rdquo; The doctor&rsquo;s
buzzer had sounded and she had to hurry away to the
inner sanctum.</p>
<p>Petra, who had only just arrived at the office, was a
little late. Dick Wilder had slept last night at the
Allens&rsquo; and offered to drive her into town this morning.
He had, however, overslept and been late in coming for
her. But that had seemed a feeble explanation when
Petra offered it to Janet a minute ago and she hoped
now that Doctor Pryne need not know of it. Janet, she
felt sure, would not mention it unless he asked. As his
door was soundproof, the chances were he did not know
whether she had come late or early. He himself had
been in there since eight. But she decided to depend only
on the trains after this. They were never late. She
wanted, with all her soul, to be as scrupulous and perfect
as humanly possible in this job.</p>
<p>She went into the dressing room, put her hat on the
shelf, powdered her face and held her wrists for a few
seconds under the cold-water faucet. The papers had
promised a day of record-breaking heat for June, and
now, only a little after nine, the thermometer in the
dressing-room window, here in the shade, registered
eighty-five. Petra was not like Clare&mdash;and Shelley&mdash;elated
and toned up by heat. Hot city days frightened
her a little and filled her with an anticipation of some
unknown but dreaded eventuality. But now that she had
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
a real and an important job, she must be superior to this
idiosyncrasy, must keep her mind clear for action and
deny the childish mood.</p>
<p>It was not yet time for the telephone to begin its
morning bombardment and she would have leisure for
a little study. Getting her shorthand textbook out of its
drawer, she drew pencil and paper toward her and
prepared for strenuous work. Janet had been &ldquo;an angel&rdquo;
(Petra&rsquo;s expression) and constituted herself Petra&rsquo;s
shorthand teacher. She said that there was no reason
whatever why Petra, at the end of a year&rsquo;s work here,
shouldn&rsquo;t be prepared to take dictation from anybody,
typewrite rapidly, and have a profession at her finger
tips. But during this year of learning, Petra was determined
to be worth every dollar that Doctor Pryne paid
her. He was not her friend&mdash;he never could be now&mdash;and
it must be a strictly business exchange between
them and an honest one.... If you really use your
brain, really concentrate, heat&mdash;even city heat&mdash;is
nothing. The human brain, and the will back of it, <i>cut
through discomfort like a knife</i>. Well, perhaps that
was all that Clare meant, when she always said that hot
days exhilarated her. Overcoming the wretchedness of
stifling heat, being superior to it, was the exhilaration.
Indeed, Petra found herself exhilarated at this moment.
It was exhilarating to concentrate on these word-symbols,
master them, and be of some account in the world!</p>
<p>But at this moment of full content&mdash;for it was content&mdash;Petra&rsquo;s
telephone surprisingly buzzed. Her voice&mdash;she
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
heard it herself, answering&mdash;had an elated ring.
But the voice that sounded in reply was no strange
voice from the outside. It was Doctor Pryne himself,
speaking to her from behind his closed door only a few
yards away. He was asking her to have lunch with him
at one-thirty at the Copley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m lunching with Dick Wilder. I&rsquo;m afraid
I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is all she said and it was uttered with polite
deliberateness. But her hand, putting down the telephone,
was shaking. And this surprising phenomenon
had hardly impressed itself on Petra&rsquo;s attention before
she was aware of the thunderous circulation of her
blood.... What had so startled her body! Her employer&rsquo;s
voice, it seemed. But the invitation and her
having to refuse it had meant very little to her conscious
thinking self. Did the body have a life of its own,
then,&mdash;fears and delights, even thoughts of its own?
It seemed so. But she had first learned it on Saturday
afternoon, when Doctor Pryne had lighted her cigarette
for her. As he held the match, her body had given her
this same surprise then. It had been Doctor Pryne then
and it was Doctor Pryne again now. He had more significance
to her, it seemed, than she herself knew. But
her body knew.... It was instinct of some sort, she
supposed. She was remembering one astonishing experience
she had had of an animal&rsquo;s instinct. It occurred the
summer she had been sent to camp where there was riding.
She and a few others had lost their way on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
country roads and had been caught by the dark. Petra
was riding ahead, loving the dark and the adventure,
when suddenly her horse stopped and she felt him
bristling under her. She felt his fear but stubbornly
tried to urge him on. Whatever he was afraid of, they
must get away from it. She was as frightened as the
horse, but her desire was to plunge on and out of the
situation&mdash;whatever it was. But a wiser and older girl,
coming along, dismounted, walked cautiously a few
yards ahead and found that a bridge was down over a
deep gorge. Petra&rsquo;s horse could not have seen it. Had
the sound of the rushing water proclaimed no bridge
above it to his sensitive ears?... But what bridge was
down now? Why was her blood thundering like this and
her mind at a standstill?</p>
<p>It passed almost as suddenly as it had come. The
thundering blood sank back to the unknown and unconscious
rhythms of its usual courses. But as this was
Petra&rsquo;s second experience only of the alert separate
mind of the body, she was left strangely shaken by it.
It took some effort to return her attention to the shorthand
textbook, and she was glad when the telephone
finally began ringing in earnest and she could put aside
her self-imposed and solitary work.</p>
<p>For a while everything went smoothly. Petra really
seemed to have an instinct for discriminating between
the important and unimportant and it is certain that
her magnetic young voice won instant confidence from
the unseen inquirers; they felt that she would remember
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
their requests and do her best in getting Doctor Pryne&rsquo;s
attention for them the first minute possible. She wrote
everything down in a tidy, self-conscious hand and filed
what should be filed, all the while feeling effectual and
important. If the few patients waiting their turns in the
little room looked at her more than at the magazines
and books they pretended to be reading, she was unaware
of it.</p>
<p>The door into the outer hall was standing wide open
in the interest of all the draft possible; and so since
Petra&rsquo;s shoulder was turned that way, and the latest
comer wore rubber-soled sneakers, she was not aware
of him until he came around her desk and stood over
her. The little desk, as he stood before her, leaning on
it, suddenly became spindly, a mere chip, he was so
large and dynamic. He was looking at Petra in surprise
that she was not Janet. So she read his expression. She
noticed, even in her first startled glance up at him, how
blue the eyes were in his bronzed face and how the black
brows over them met in a straight line across his high,
straight nose. She had never seen eyes of so intense and
deep a blue, she thought. They were rather like her
own, had she realized it, for it was a strange coincidence,
but the girl at the desk and the man bending over it
might have been brother and sister. Their coloring, their
physiques and their vitality were all in the same key.</p>
<p>The surprise in the man&rsquo;s face was perhaps more like
anger than surprise, after all. A sort of tortured anger,
Petra thought. The intense blue of his eyes burned down
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
at her with angry questioning. But his fine, clean-cut lips
were set in a defiant line as if he meant never to speak.
The thought flashed through Petra&rsquo;s mind that he might
be an insane patient of Doctor Pryne&rsquo;s who had broken
loose from confinement and was seeking out the man
who had consigned him to the asylum, to shoot him.
But instantly she knew it wasn&rsquo;t so; the fire in the intense
blue eyes was fire of intelligence burning to an
expression almost as articulate as speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to see Doctor Pryne?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I
am sorry but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She got no farther. He had reached a swift hand and
snatching a letter from the top of the pile the postman
had only a minute ago deposited there, turned it over
and, picking up a pencil, wrote on its back, &ldquo;I am dumb.
Neil McCloud. No appointment. Only want to see Pryne
for a minute. Will wait till he can work me in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dumb! This vital creature, radiating power and
strength! Petra held out her hand for the pencil. But
he did not give it to her. He wrote again, the strokes
of his script swift and angry, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not deaf. Speak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; she said. She could not talk to him while
he towered like that. It was like standing under an
avalanche of physical and mental force. There was a
chair close to her desk. He took it. She felt that he
might mind having the other patients, who had appointments,
hear him being refused one, and so she
leaned toward him and explained the situation almost
in a whisper. Doctor Pryne had been out of town and as
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
a consequence was extraordinarily busy to-day. He
couldn&rsquo;t possibly see people without appointments, even
for a minute. But next week&mdash;She took up the appointment
book. The minute McCloud had written his
name Petra had placed him, for on Janet&rsquo;s advice she
had studied and learned the names of the regular patients
by heart during her first day here. She fluttered
the pages of her book and came to McCloud. He had
an appointment for Saturday afternoon, to-morrow. That
was odd. Janet had said that Doctor Pryne kept his weekends
absolutely free for his writing. But here it was in
Janet&rsquo;s hand&mdash;McCloud, four o&rsquo;clock, June 28.</p>
<p>She hesitated over it. Ought she to suggest that Mr.
McCloud wait for Janet&rsquo;s next appearance from the inner
office? This was the first time to-day that Petra had felt
so uncertain of her ground. But then she decided, &ldquo;No.
I&rsquo;m in. I must swim. That is what both Doctor Pryne
and Janet expect of me. McCloud&rsquo;ll have to wait for his
appointment like everybody else.&rdquo;&mdash;She looked across
at him. Blue eyes met blue eyes, his tormented and angry,
hers cool but sorry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&mdash;&rdquo; she began, but again
he snatched at the pencil. &ldquo;OK,&rdquo; he almost tore it into
the envelope. And then he added, underlining it, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
tell him I called. I&rsquo;d rather you didn&rsquo;t. Back Saturday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Halfway to the door he swung around and came back
to Petra. She handed him the pencil. He wrote&mdash;but
this time in small, scrupulously clear characters&mdash;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re
a damned beautiful girl.&rdquo; She had read it easily
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
upside down as he wrote but he was gone before the
color flamed in her face.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, when Janet came out of the inner
sanctum, trailing a patient, and went over to Petra&rsquo;s
desk, Petra showed her the envelope; but she had erased
McCloud&rsquo;s last remark. The secretary frowned. It worried
her, for some reason or other. That was obvious.
After a minute of brooding over it, she whispered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sorry you let him go, Petra. The doctor would have
made a point of seeing Mr. McCloud. It must be something
very special he wanted, really special, I mean.
But you couldn&rsquo;t know.... I think we&rsquo;d better do
what he asks and not say anything about it now to the
doctor. It would bother him. I&rsquo;m sorry I wasn&rsquo;t here.
He must have hated explaining to you about his speech.
He&rsquo;s morbidly sensitive about it. It was hard enough
the first time he came and wrote it all down for me&mdash;but
to have to do it all over again&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was as bad as that! Janet&rsquo;s expression even more
than the words she said told Petra how serious a blunder
she had made in sending McCloud away. It was so serious,
in fact, that Janet wanted to protect Doctor Pryne
from knowing that it had happened at all. But as to
the man&rsquo;s embarrassment, Petra was skeptical, remembering
the sentence she had read upside down!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look here, Petra, don&rsquo;t let this one first mistake
discourage you,&rdquo; Janet murmured quickly, as the doctor&rsquo;s
buzzer summoned her to bring in the next patient.
&ldquo;Go on swimming. Don&rsquo;t get self-mistrustful. It&rsquo;s like
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
riding. After a spill you must get right up and mount
again, or you&rsquo;re queered. Better luck next time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At lunch Dick Wilder found Petra more bafflingly
uncommunicative than usual, even, and she ate almost
nothing of the very expensive and knowing meal he had
ordered for her. What use was it for him to chatter on
about Green Doors&mdash;and incidentally, of course, Clare&mdash;with
some one who murmured back mere Yeses and
Noes! The only consolation that Dick got from that
luncheon hour was the overt admiration he saw in surrounding
faces for his companion. These men and women
had no way of knowing that his companion was as completely
uninteresting as she was completely beautiful.
They probably thought him much to be envied, extraordinarily
lucky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said rather desperately, when he
opened the door of his car to let her out in front of her
office building, &ldquo;let me drive you out to-night, Petra.
It will be beastly going in the train in this heat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clare is giving that big dinner party to-night,&rdquo; Petra
reminded him. &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t have a minute for you. Some
other night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Dick persisted. He was ready to take his chances.
When they got to Green Doors he would go in with
Petra for a few minutes and stay talking. Clare might
be around somewhere. They could exchange one word
at least, one look. It would be little Sophia&rsquo;s bedtime.
He might be invited up to the nursery to join with
little Sophia&rsquo;s nurse in her role of enchanted chorus
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
to the nightly repeated scene&mdash;the cherub&rsquo;s supper hour.
But he said nothing of his real designs to Petra. He
merely exclaimed, &ldquo;What has Clare to do with it? You&rsquo;re
a funny girl! It&rsquo;s you I&rsquo;m asking. I&rsquo;ll be down here at
the door at four.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Janet&rsquo;s door, the doctor&rsquo;s door, the door into the public
hall were all wide open when Petra got back. Janet
heard her come in and sang out from the dressing room,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just off for lunch, Petra. Won&rsquo;t be gone twenty
minutes. Too hot to eat.&rdquo; Then, as Petra came up behind
her, she turned from the mirror where she had been
adjusting her hat and her voice changed. &ldquo;You poor
child! What is the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. What should be?&rdquo; Petra put away her hat
and got out her compact. But Janet would not accept
the nonchalant denial. &ldquo;I know what&rsquo;s wrong. That
McCloud business. But cheer up. For months after I began
this job I averaged about half a dozen mistakes a
week. Nobody&rsquo;s infallible. And anyway, I&rsquo;ve reconsidered
it. There is no real reason why that young man should
consider himself an exception and come around without
appointments. He did the same thing last week. And
Doctor Pryne saw him and was over an hour late in
leaving the office as a consequence. To-day he would
probably have gone without his lunch. It&rsquo;s really rather
cheeky. To-day may make him see it. I myself wouldn&rsquo;t
have dared send him off, because I know how the doctor
feels, but you didn&rsquo;t know, and he only got what
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
he deserves. So cheer up. You&rsquo;re in charge now till I
return. The doctor won&rsquo;t be back before half-past two,
probably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Petra was not much comforted. Her confidence
in her own adequacy had been so high only so few
hours ago! And ever since the McCloud incident she
had felt dashed. But how was she to know who was
important, of the people who came to the office or called
on the telephone, as long as they remained merely
names to her in her appointment book and in the bare
files in her desk. Janet, of course, knew the intimate
details of all the cases. She took their &ldquo;histories&rdquo; down
in shorthand, and even some of the conferences later,
and filed them in the big steel cases in the inner office.
If Petra, now, had known something of Mr. McCloud&rsquo;s
&ldquo;history,&rdquo; she might have known what to do with
him this morning. But Janet, in initiating her into
the work, had told her absolutely nothing of the
personalities she would so soon be dealing with. Her
information had confined itself strictly to names and
ages. It was too great a handicap!</p>
<p>Besides, Petra was interested on her own account in
this McCloud now. Very much so! Any one would
be.... His tormented impatient look.... The way
his very black brows met in a straight line over his
straight high nose. She had never seen brows like that.
It gave a look of dominance, of strength.... His hands
were the hands of a workman, stained with oil or grease,
and the fingernails were cut very short where they
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
were not broken. Yet strangely, those hands were as
expressive and impatient as his face.... And the
upside-down sentence&mdash;well&mdash;that was a touch of
mere deviltry. His eyes had mocked, as he pushed the
envelope toward her&mdash;and was gone!</p>
<p>The heat in the reception office was stifling. Holding
your wrists under water really didn&rsquo;t help, except for
the minute you were doing it. As for getting out the
shorthand textbook in this lull between the morning and
afternoon appointments, Petra simply couldn&rsquo;t. She was
smothered, dismayed by the heat. It was really a kind
of drowning, this airlessness. Janet had looked so cool
and superior to it. She had said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s torrid, isn&rsquo;t it!&rdquo;
but she hadn&rsquo;t minded it really. She had created the
effect, even as she mentioned it, of brushing mere
physical discomfort from her clear, cool self as if it were
a fly.</p>
<p>There was, however, a slight breeze coming through
from Doctor Pryne&rsquo;s big windows. A paper on his desk
rustled intermittently. It might blow off. Petra decided
to go in there and put a book or an inkwell, some solid
object, on it. But when she had secured the object&mdash;a
package of Luckies, as it happened&mdash;she turned away
from the desk to the steel filing case across the room and
stood looking at it curiously. She could read the letters
on the faces of the boxes from where she stood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<h2 id="c12"><i>Chapter Twelve</i></h2><div class="img"><img src="images/ch.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="30" /></div>
<p>Petra was pulling out the drawer marked in
small black letters Mc. She pulled it slowly, as one
might open a door onto an unknown landscape. She herself
thought of Alice. &ldquo;It might be the rabbit hole and
here am I on the verge of tumbling down it.&rdquo; Indeed,
she felt herself a second Alice and as if this deep drawer
held a wonderland into which she was about to escape
from the stifling hot afternoon of the upper world. Could
she have known what it held for her, how different her
hesitation in going on pulling out the drawer would have
been, how much faster her heart would have beat!</p>
<p>She ran her fingers over the tops of the stiff white
cards and came to those marked at the upper right-hand
corners, &ldquo;Neil McCloud.&rdquo; There were dozens of them
in McCloud&rsquo;s own handwriting&mdash;the handwriting, at
least, of that one last sentence of his which she had read
upside down. Petra lifted them out, removing first the
metal clip that held them together. Leaving the Mc
drawer open, she leaned against other closed drawers
and started to read.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p><i>Neil McCloud. Age twenty-six. Irish-American.
Catholic. No known insanity in family.</i></p>
<p>It read as if it had been written in answer to questions
put to him by Doctor Pryne. Ordinarily the patient
would have answered vocally, and Janet, or Doctor
Pryne, taken it all down; but in this case, since McCloud
could not speak, the answers were written by the patient
himself. It seemed that the small, scrupulous script of
the upside-down sentence was his ordinary writing when
he was not furious....</p>
<p>Petra turned the card over and read on: &ldquo;Oldest of
five. Father a garage proprietor in Springfield, Mass.
I graduated from High School tenth in class of ninety.
My mother wanted me to go to college but I wouldn&rsquo;t.
Went to work for my father as a stop-gap. Wanted to
get with airplanes. Father paid me a skilled mechanic&rsquo;s
wages because I was by that time a skilled mechanic,&mdash;grew
up with the engines, so to speak. Machinery interested
me more than books. Except aeronautics books.
Read all of those the library had and bought all I could
find. I got in with the fellow who runs the Ocean Road
Airport. Spent all my spare time there. Took flying lessons
by moonlight. Bought a second-hand plane on savings
and credit and began taking people up for hire.
Father against it. Wouldn&rsquo;t let me live at home unless
I worked for him.... One day my kid brother turned
up at the field. He was the baby. Eleven years old. I
knew the folks had forbidden him to go up with me.
All the kids were forbidden. But he had hooked a ride
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
out, skipped school, and said he would tell father when
he got home, and take his licking. He hated lickings as
much as anybody, but it would be worth it to fly. I
agreed with him it would. He was captain of his grade
football team, a great little kid. After my mother, I
guess he meant more to me than anybody living. Anyway,
I took him up. We had a grand ride, all afternoon,
over four States. Then, making the landing in the field,
the propeller broke and we hit the ground wrong. The
kid was killed. Broken neck. He died in my arms without
the sacraments. I never saw my mother again. They
wouldn&rsquo;t let me into the house. Dad wouldn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t
think mother ever knew I came. She died that fall. She
had been poorly ever since Stephen was born, the kid&mdash;that
was killed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Came to Boston. Got job. Chauffeur for Malcolm
Dayton, banker. Eloped with his daughter. We were
married by a justice of the peace but Edyth suspected
I mightn&rsquo;t feel really married unless a priest blessed
us. She looked up the priest of our parish and I went to
him. No, hadn&rsquo;t gone to the Funeral Mass for the kid
even, and never to confession since the smash. The priest
made me ashamed but agreed to get the dispensations.
He talked to Edyth and assured himself she was old
enough to know her own mind and really wanted to be
my wife. She is ten years older than me. So I confessed
and was taken back and received communion, and we
were married again in the rectory before the housekeeper
and janitor. Edyth was to take instruction. I
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
could have lived alone outside the Church all right,
but couldn&rsquo;t have rested easy with my wife outside it.
So I was glad Edyth insisted, I guess. Remembered my
mother too well! Couldn&rsquo;t imagine the mother of my
children not a Catholic!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dayton went crazy when we told him. He wrote that
he would buy a divorce for Edyth any time she asked
him to, but until then to keep away from him. We had
a baby the first year. A boy. I got a job selling the new
Ajax cars. I thought we were pretty well off, but Edyth
didn&rsquo;t. We had a nice apartment and a maid. My mother
never had a maid. Edyth&rsquo;s friends stuck to her. They
were fine. Some of them I liked a lot. But she was never
really mine. Somehow she was her father&rsquo;s girl. The
baby was born at the Lying-In. The day they were coming
home, I had to give a driving lesson in Arlington,
but a girl friend of Edyth&rsquo;s was bringing them and
would help the nurse and the maid fix them up comfortably.
But I came home and found nobody but the
nurse. Called the hospital and they told me that Dayton
had come for his daughter and grandson. Called the
house. Got Dayton himself. Sorry&mdash;can&rsquo;t remember a
word he said. But I knew that Edyth and the baby were
with him and weren&rsquo;t coming home. And the next day
he sent a lawyer around who told me that the old man
had had me watched and that they had a clear case for
a divorce. They had one framed, all right&mdash;but no use
going into that. I had not been unfaithful. No, I told
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
you, I can&rsquo;t remember a single word he said on the
&rsquo;phone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t say a word to the nurse who had
stood staring at me while I &rsquo;phoned. Found I couldn&rsquo;t.
But I thought it was because I was crying. The baby and
his mother not coming home, you know. Thought it
was tears in my throat. I thought so then, I mean. I
walked out of the apartment, got into the car, drove all
night. At dawn I was back in Boston. I don&rsquo;t remember
where I drove or anything about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I stopped for gasoline once or twice during the
night. I held up my fingers to show how many gallons
and didn&rsquo;t say a word. But I didn&rsquo;t realize it was because
I couldn&rsquo;t speak until I got back to the apartment
in the morning. The nurse had slept there and was waiting
for her money. Yes, my throat closes up whenever
I try to speak. It&rsquo;s like tears&mdash;or a sob. Don&rsquo;t like to try
any more. No, haven&rsquo;t been to Mass since the Sunday
before Edyth and the boy were coming home from the
hospital. No&mdash;don&rsquo;t want to see a priest. I&rsquo;ve lost my
faith, I think. No, my family know nothing about me.
They won&rsquo;t, either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ajax people kept me on as a mechanic. It&rsquo;s
charity, really. They&rsquo;re as hard hit as all the rest by
the depression. They really can&rsquo;t afford a mechanic who
can&rsquo;t talk to the people who drive in. The boss sent me
to you. I make thirty a week. Can pay you ten. Ten a
week goes to the smashed plane debt. If you don&rsquo;t cure
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
me quickly, I&rsquo;ll disappear. The boss is risking his own
job, keeping me on. Yes, the boy is fine. When I saw
him at the hospital he looked like my kid brother. The
kid would have been his uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There the history proper ended and Janet&rsquo;s typing began.
It was a report of the physical condition of the
patient. Doctor Pryne had, apparently, passed McCloud
on to various specialists. Petra skipped all this. It was
technical and dull but as much as she took in appeared
to rate McCloud&rsquo;s physical condition as excellent. All
the remaining cards in the pile, a dozen or more, written
on both sides, in Doctor Pryne&rsquo;s illegible hand, might
as well have been inscribed in Chinese for all Petra could
read of them. They appeared to record the experiments
in treatment Doctor Pryne had tried on the case, and
would have been fascinating, Petra thought, if only she
could have read three consecutive words.</p>
<p>But one sentence was clear,&mdash;and underlined: &ldquo;<i>Must
find out what Malcolm Dayton said to him on the telephone.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she read this, Petra heard some one breathe....
She had not noticed the step in the reception office nor
in this room, but she heard the breath, soft as it was.
She looked up from the card she was studying and saw
Janet. It was the secretary&rsquo;s sharply indrawn breath that
had so startled Petra. But when she woke to the expression
on her new friend&rsquo;s face, her very blood ran cold.
This was not Janet, the intelligent, the kind, the clever
Janet. What had happened to her? What was the matter?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;Petra Farwell! What are you doing with those files?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reading about McCloud. I wanted to learn....&rdquo;
But her explanation died stillborn. Suddenly, like a
thunderclap, Petra knew what a fool she had been, what
a terrible thing she had done. She knew now why Janet
looked as if she had come upon a murderer, his hands
dripping blood. Petra put her hand up to her mouth. It
was dry and her tongue was dry.</p>
<p>Janet said &ldquo;You are stark crazy&mdash;or else you are a
plain fool. It isn&rsquo;t just the sneakiness of it&mdash;reading
private records. It&rsquo;s the cruelty. It&rsquo;s violating another
person&rsquo;s rights to his own secrets. Petra, how <i>could you</i>?
<i>Are</i> you crazy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She must be. Petra thought so herself now. It was
worse than reading other people&rsquo;s letters, reading a doctor&rsquo;s
records of cases. Any one who wasn&rsquo;t crazy would
know that. Even young children knew better than to
open drawers in other people&rsquo;s houses. She <i>was</i> crazy,
crazy, crazy! She was ready to die!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why weren&rsquo;t the files locked, Miss Frazier? How
did this happen? How was it possible?&rdquo; Doctor Pryne
had come in without either of them noticing. His voice
was hard&mdash;cold too&mdash;like ice. There was a white area
around his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You went off with the key, Doctor. You were writing
up the Fountain dope. I knew the files weren&rsquo;t locked
but I was leaving Miss Farwell in charge, you see. I was
gone only a few minutes. I never dreamed that she
herself would open the files. How could I?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>The secretary had nothing more to say, nothing more
to look. Her face was paper white&mdash;white with anger at
Petra, at herself, at Doctor Pryne. She went into her
own little office and shut the door behind her with
something approximating a slam. In another second the
racket of an angry typewriter came in from her office by
way of the doctor&rsquo;s open windows.</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Better put those cards away now. Are they in their
right order?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petra looked down from Doctor Pryne&rsquo;s cold face to
her hands and what they were all unconsciously still
holding. She put the cards back into the drawer with
careful quickness. &ldquo;Yes, they are in their right order.&rdquo;
She almost whispered it. Her throat felt thick. Perhaps
she was going to lose her speech as McCloud had lost
his, or it might be tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Petra! Why <i>did</i> you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to know about this Neil McCloud. I was
terribly interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; And then with sudden sick suspicion Lewis
asked, &ldquo;Do you know his wife? Is that why you were
interested?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petra nodded. &ldquo;I do know Edyth, of course. She&rsquo;s one
of Clare&rsquo;s friends. And I knew her before that, in Cambridge.
But I didn&rsquo;t know she was like this&mdash;cruel....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Petra, this is impossible. I simply can&rsquo;t take it in,
what you&rsquo;ve done!&rdquo; He was feeling in various pockets
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
with quick exasperated motions as he spoke, but his eyes
had not left her face. &ldquo;Lord! Miss Frazier was right.
Here&rsquo;s the key. That lets her out.&rdquo; He added, &ldquo;And us
in&mdash;you and me in deep together. We both ought to
go to jail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petra exclaimed, &ldquo;Not you! You couldn&rsquo;t know I
might be&mdash;abnormally dishonorable. But I haven&rsquo;t told
you really why I did it. And you asked. I didn&rsquo;t know
McCloud was that McCloud&mdash;Edyth&rsquo;s husband. I
didn&rsquo;t even think about the names being the same. He
came to the office this morning to see you. I said he must
wait till to-morrow. Janet said that was a mistake, that
you would have seen him. It came to me, while Janet
was out at lunch, that if I had known about this case,
McCloud&rsquo;s case&mdash;as Janet knew about it&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t
have made the mistake. So I walked right in here and
looked him up&mdash;the way you would in a library, you
know, a Who&rsquo;s Who or something. I wanted to be efficient,
to understand what it was all about. But I <i>was</i>
crazy. It was as bad as reading private letters. I see that
now. I&rsquo;m not like Shelley. The heat numbs me. My
brains stand still....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if they did!&rdquo; But then he was sorry. He
needn&rsquo;t have said that. But could he believe her in what
she had just said? Could he believe that it had not been
mere curiosity about the mistaken marriage of a woman
she happened to know that had brought Petra to his
files? Well, strangely, he did believe her. She had lied,
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
he supposed, about the book she said she had been reading
that afternoon at Green Doors, and he knew she had
lied about his keeping her working here after hours. All
the same, he believed that she was telling the truth now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what McCloud wanted. Wish I had seen
him. Didn&rsquo;t he leave any message?&rdquo; He would make
her forget his anger, which was so quickly passing.</p>
<p>Petra told him what McCloud had written, except for
the upside-down sentence. &ldquo;Perhaps I shouldn&rsquo;t have
told you he came, since he asked me particularly not to.
But I couldn&rsquo;t have you think it was because I knew
Edyth. Curiosity of that sort&mdash;well, I wouldn&rsquo;t have
felt any temptation. Truly, I wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes were studying her face. She went on, &ldquo;Of
course, you will fire me. There&rsquo;s no reason you shouldn&rsquo;t.
But since it was you who made my stepmother cut my
allowance in two, you ought to persuade her to give it
back again&mdash;if I&rsquo;m not to have this job now. Will you
do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped, waiting for him to answer. But he said
nothing, merely continued to look at her, while his expression
changed. It was ice again. With the instinct to
justify herself she stammered, &ldquo;I told you&mdash;I <i>told you</i>&mdash;at
the guest house&mdash;Saturday&mdash;that it was a <i>salary</i>
Clare paid me, not an allowance. I know that she said it
wasn&rsquo;t so&mdash;that very night&mdash;that you heard her. But
why should you believe her more than me? Anyway, I
must have that thousand again. It is your fault I lost it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you want to keep this job?&rdquo; Lewis asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>He was beginning to admit to himself, at last, that Petra
Farwell was beyond him. He simply did not understand
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I do want to keep it. Very much. But how can
I&mdash;after this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would be much better to keep it and make
a success of it than&mdash;than go back to the twenty-four-hour-a-day
stepdaughter job. Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petra nodded. She had a voice but she did not
trust it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easier, even?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re a great help to Miss Frazier. She
says so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t now.&rdquo; She <i>sounded</i> all right. You couldn&rsquo;t
hear a tear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I think she will. She was angry with herself
just now, more than with you, I imagine. Just as I
was&mdash;with myself, I mean. Am still, as a matter of fact.
Miss Frazier realized that she should have warned you
about the privacy of the files and I knew that it was very
nearly criminal of me to leave the files unlocked while I
was out. So we&rsquo;ve all had a miserable time of it. Did you
look at anything besides McCloud&rsquo;s history, by the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. If you&rsquo;ll only wait a little this afternoon
till I&rsquo;m free, Petra, I&rsquo;d like the pleasure of driving you
out to Meadowbrook. I want you to finish about Teresa.
Of course, you know that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dick&rsquo;s driving me out.&rdquo; But as Petra saw Doctor
Pryne&rsquo;s disappointment, she said quickly almost the precise
words she had said earlier to Dick, &ldquo;But it wouldn&rsquo;t
pay you, anyway, even if he wasn&rsquo;t. Clare is giving a big
dinner party to-night and she&rsquo;ll be busy seeing to things.
She does the flowers herself, cuts them and everything.
It takes simply hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord! What has Mrs. Farwell&rsquo;s cutting the
flowers to do with it? It is you I want to talk to. When
will you finish about Teresa, then? You said when we
were alone next. And will you take me to see her? I
have been looking forward to seeing her again ever
since our talk&mdash;at the guest house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis saw the look of deviousness creep over Petra&rsquo;s
face then, and he knew, almost certainly, that whatever
she said next would have no reality in it. She was baffling
to exasperation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you to see Teresa if she invites you. But
there&rsquo;s nothing more to tell you, really. Only I beg you
not to mention her to Clare again, not to tell her any
more of all that I told you. I don&rsquo;t know how much
you did tell her. She hasn&rsquo;t said a word about it and I
haven&rsquo;t asked. But you won&rsquo;t again, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear! That was a stupid slip I made. I broke my
promise of secrecy. But why should I talk about anything
with Mrs. Farwell? It is you I am trying to talk with&mdash;and
you put me off. You don&rsquo;t say anything <i>true</i> to me any
more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want to know? About Teresa, I mean?
I&rsquo;ve told you the absolute truth about her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know that&mdash;as far as it went. But I want the
rest, all of it!&rdquo; Lewis exclaimed. &ldquo;What Teresa did
next. You said she was ready to become a secretary and
something happened. I want to know what happened,
what she is doing now, how things are with her. I&rsquo;ve
been waiting days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But even before Petra opened her lips, Lewis gave up
hope of her answering him truly. He saw her choosing
between several possible answers. And when she said,
deliberately, very carefully, &ldquo;Teresa got her chance to
go to college. She supports herself by dress-designing.
She&rsquo;s all right, thank you,&rdquo; Lewis knew that while these
might be facts, they weren&rsquo;t the truth; they left him
exactly where he had been left Saturday. He knew not
one real thing more. The swordlike reticence in Petra&rsquo;s
gentian eyes guarded her against his knowing now every
bit as effectively as against Clare&rsquo;s, her father&rsquo;s, and
Dick&rsquo;s. But Dick! Saturday Dick had seemed to stand
with Clare and Farwell over against Petra&rsquo;s guard. But
had that, perhaps, changed? Certainly he was very much
in evidence&mdash;lunching with Petra to-day, driving her
out to-night. Lewis himself had been away four days.
Anything could have happened in four days. Had Dick
waked up, come to his senses?</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s your telephone,&rdquo; he said then. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been
ringing some time. Miss Frazier can&rsquo;t hear it with her
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
door shut and typing like that. You&rsquo;d better see to it.
It&rsquo;s your job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petra flew to her desk, shutting the doctor&rsquo;s door
softly, on the wing. The one thought she took with her,
and it was utterly comforting, in spite of the tears in her
throat, was that she still had a job.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<h2 id="c13"><i>Chapter Thirteen</i></h2><div class="img"><img src="images/ch.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="30" /></div>
<p>Saturday noon Lewis came near having a scene with
his secretary, when he insisted that, for once, she must
take the half holiday. &ldquo;No, you cannot have the next
chapter.&rdquo; He felt rather like an ugly dog barking up
at her, with his paws on a bone&mdash;the bone his manuscript.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to keep it to revise. I fumbled it terribly
last night. Couldn&rsquo;t seem to concentrate. You get along
out to some beach or other. Lie in the sun. You&rsquo;re white
as a daisy. Good-by and thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There had been strife; but Lewis, continuing to ape
the behavior of a dog with his bone, and doing it rather
successfully, had finally won and Miss Frazier went for
her hat and bag. But she came back in a second to explain,
&ldquo;Petra is staying to practice typing. Won&rsquo;t it disturb you
if you&rsquo;re working here? Mr. Wilder is coming for her at
four. She wants to wait for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! Again?&rdquo; But Lewis pulled himself up. He
said in answer to her question, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll disturb
me. That door is very nearly soundproof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to tell you that she is broken-hearted about
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
yesterday, Doctor. She can&rsquo;t get over it. Nothing like
that will ever happen again, I know. She&rsquo;s awfully
silly in some ways but she&rsquo;s&mdash;she&rsquo;s all right. Really
she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know she is.&rdquo; But Lewis looked up with quick
gratitude at his secretary. She was rather all right herself,
he was thinking. He smiled at her. It was a more
human, a more personal smile than she had ever had
from her employer before. She smiled, dimly, back. She
was silly herself, a thousand times sillier than Petra. If
Doctor Pryne saw that she was fighting tears, he would
think she had gone out of her head. She turned quickly
away.</p>
<p>In the reception office Janet said to Petra, &ldquo;The door&rsquo;s
soundproof. Doctor Pryne mightn&rsquo;t even know you are
staying if I hadn&rsquo;t told him. But it&rsquo;s a long time till four.
Don&rsquo;t work too hard. I&rsquo;ll meet you Sunday at twelve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petra answered, her hands suspended over the typewriter
keys, &ldquo;I love it, Janet. I love typing. You&rsquo;re going
to be proud of me some day. I&rsquo;ll be as good a secretary
as you are. To-morrow at noon, yes. How nice it
will be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was at two. At three-thirty Lewis put the manuscript
chapter into his brief-case and got up, stretching.
He lit a cigarette, turned to the window and stood looking
out for a minute. Then he took a few quick paces
back and forth between the windows and the reception-office
door. Then he pushed the patients&rsquo; easy chair from
its usual position till its back was at the window for whatever
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
breeze there was. Dick was coming for Petra at
four. Lewis himself expected McCloud at the same time.
Well, this was only half-past three. He opened the door
into his reception office.</p>
<p>Petra was working at shorthand now, her typewriter
covered up until Monday. One hand was in her curls,
ruffling them, and she appeared to be eating the rubber
end of her pencil. She looked at Lewis dazedly. She was
white with the heat in the stuffy little room. The doors
should all have been opened&mdash;or else she shouldn&rsquo;t have
stayed. It was not quite so warm as yesterday, but it was
bad enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a breeze in my office,&rdquo; Lewis said. &ldquo;A baby
one, but rather nice. Put away the lessons, do, and come
along in. I&rsquo;m going to lay off too&mdash;till four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The violet of her frock was cool against the dark
leather of the patients&rsquo; chair. Why did she wear a yellow
belt? Her thin stockings were yellow, gold-yellow.
Yellow and violet, with her gentian eyes, and vital gold-brown
curls brushed on her neck, back from her ears,
made Petra too lovely to look at with a level gaze. Why
shouldn&rsquo;t Petra care hugely about clothes and spend all
the dollars a year on them she could lay her hands on&mdash;if
clothes did this! The yellow belt was magic&mdash;a narrow
yellow magic made of nothing in the world but a
silly, twisted bit of silk cord.</p>
<p>Hundreds of women had sat in that chair facing
Lewis, for years past, and at no other time could he recall
noticing what one of them had worn. But he could no
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
more help noticing this violet, cool frock of Petra&rsquo;s with
the yellow belt than he could help noticing the texture of
flowers near at hand. The loveliness of Petra&rsquo;s frocks
was as inescapable as the loveliness of flowers.</p>
<p>He offered her a cigarette. She took one but only, he
felt, because she did not see what they were going to
talk about and this was something to relieve the awkwardness....
This time, when he held the match for
her, their eyes did not meet....</p>
<p>Lewis put his arm along his desk. First of all, he had
a duty to perform. He should have done it yesterday had
he not taken it for granted it was unnecessary. But in
the middle of the night he had been bothered by that
taking for granted. Now was the time to get it off his
mind,&mdash;and pray heaven it was not too late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not to mind what I&rsquo;m going to say, Petra.
Probably it&rsquo;s totally unnecessary. But you will give me
your promise now, won&rsquo;t you, quite solemnly, never so
long as you live, to tell any one&mdash;any one at all&mdash;anything
that you learned about my patient McCloud
yesterday. You haven&rsquo;t mentioned any of it to a soul, have
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petra looked at him. No faltering now. Truth was on
the way. She said almost before he had finished, &ldquo;No, of
course I haven&rsquo;t told a soul and of course I promise. I
do understand and you can trust me.&rdquo; But even as she
finished, panic came. She put her hand to her mouth. She
had remembered something. Lewis <i>saw</i> her remember.</p>
<p>His heart sank. This was too bad&mdash;too terribly too
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
bad. He exclaimed, &ldquo;You have told some one, Petra.
Who? In God&rsquo;s name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&mdash;no, I haven&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; But she stopped the lie.
She couldn&rsquo;t lie to this man. In the first place, he could
spot it. In the second place, she did not want to, somehow.
She said, miserably, &ldquo;I told Teresa. I told her
every word. I&rsquo;d forgotten. But that doesn&rsquo;t count as telling.
It&rsquo;s like telling one&rsquo;s self. She is so safe.... I told
her that McCloud was Edyth&rsquo;s husband. She had known
her in Cambridge. And all about the flying accident. I
told her that. And his mother&rsquo;s dying. I told her, too,
how McCloud had only seen his baby at the hospital.
Less than two weeks. That seemed so unjust&mdash;so cruel!
Oh, yes, I guess I told Teresa everything. You see&mdash;You
see, <i>I thought she might help</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Petra! You are terrible!&rdquo; Lewis groaned. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Petra seemed not to mind his consternation. She
was looking past Lewis&rsquo; head, a question in her eyes.
Lewis swung around and there was Neil McCloud himself,
standing midway in the room&mdash;his expression murderous.</p>
<p>McCloud was early for his appointment and had expected
to be kept waiting until four at least. But when
he found the reception room deserted and the doctor&rsquo;s
door wide open, he naturally came to it. It had taken
him some seconds to take it in&mdash;what was going on
here&mdash;that the man he had entrusted with his confidences
as implicitly as if he had been a priest in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
confessional was using those confidences as a peg on
which to hang a flirtation with a beautiful new secretary.
They sat here in the place where he had written it all,
hashing it over together. Telling his secrets.... As
Edyth had hashed over things with her father, old man
Dayton, telling his secrets.... Terrible secrets....</p>
<p>For in this moment he remembered what Pryne had
so long wanted him to remember! Pryne had questioned
and questioned. Coaxed at his strangely blank memory.
And nothing doing. But now it was here. Clear, bright
as a lightning flash. Now, when remembering was no
good to anybody! What the old man had said, over the
telephone, when McCloud had called him up that night
to ask him what he had done with Edyth and their son,
was this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Edyth has told me everything. You killed your
brother. You broke your mother&rsquo;s heart. But you shan&rsquo;t
break my daughter&rsquo;s heart and ruin my grandson&rsquo;s life.
I have the power to protect my own. There isn&rsquo;t anything
you can say. <i>Don&rsquo;t say a word.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>And you had been obedient. You had gone dumb from
that minute. In obedience to Edyth&rsquo;s father, who knew
that you had killed your brother and broken your mother&rsquo;s
heart. Edyth had told him all that. Told the old
man. All the things you had told her before you would
marry her, in sacred confidence. And now the old man
was shouting at you through the telephone. It was as if
no time had passed since. As if you were hearing it this
minute, while you stood frozenly staring at Pryne and
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
his stenographer: &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t anything you can say.
Don&rsquo;t say a word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let the old brute shout! Keep on shouting through
your brain! You don&rsquo;t mind it now. At least this one
thing about you, Pryne shouldn&rsquo;t ever possess. One little
bit he wouldn&rsquo;t tell his beautiful stenographer&mdash;simply
because he wouldn&rsquo;t ever know it. And now you&rsquo;d get
out,&mdash;right out into the darkness which had been compassing
you ever since the moment the kid went out in
your arms.</p>
<p>Pryne was getting up. The girl was up too. Why
didn&rsquo;t your hate and scorn blast them where they stood?
It was strong enough to do that. But hate failing, there
was the revolver. No! Shut up. Don&rsquo;t think of that. The
kid&mdash;Mother&mdash;those were lives enough for you to
have destroyed. Two&mdash;three steps, and you would follow
those beloveds into the dark void. You should have
followed before. But instead you had come whining for
help to this&mdash;fashionable psychiatrist. Hell! Your teeth
were clenched with the will it took not to put your hand
to the pocket holding the revolver. It was essential that
you should be outside the door, that it should be between
you and them, or Pryne might somehow manage
to spoil it. The doctor had a look in his eyes&mdash;as if he
suspected or even knew your intention. But you weren&rsquo;t
even touching your pocket. Your hands were at your
sides. Straight down. How could Pryne know what you
were going to do?</p>
<p>Well, Pryne wouldn&rsquo;t move, wouldn&rsquo;t interfere, you
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
were sure of it, as long as you kept your eyes steady and
your hands at your sides. You started backing toward the
door, holding the skunk where he was with your scorn
of him, and his girl beside him there, wide-eyed and
scared. She was a damned beauty. You had been right
when you told her so. You would back through the door.
They should not stir. Then you would close it with one
lightning motion. But you must remember to use the
left hand. The right must be kept for the business of
shooting your brains out before either of them could
stir. It would be a neat job. That was one thing they
should never hash over together,&mdash;your <i>attempted</i>
suicide. Attempted! Like hell, attempted! You&rsquo;d have
one clean mark for that, so help you Christ.</p>
<p>At that moment McCloud&rsquo;s seeking heel felt the rise
of the doorsill, the rim of the dark void.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<h2 id="c14"><i>Chapter Fourteen</i></h2><div class="img"><img src="images/ch.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="30" /></div>
<p>On Wednesday Neil McCloud had lost his job of
mechanic for the Ajax people. At least the top boss had
come along and Neil had surmised from the dark looks
he cast in his direction, as he spoke in a confidentially
low tone to Neil&rsquo;s boss, that he was ragging him for
keeping on such a handicapped man when there were
hundreds of good men to choose from. So Neil had gone
up, as soon as the fellow had left, and discharged himself.
His boss had a wife and small children. Nobody&rsquo;s
position was any too secure these days. And the top boss
had had a very nasty look in his eye not only for Neil,
but for Neil&rsquo;s benefactor. Neil had quaked under it.
But not for himself. So he walked out of the place, just
another fellow out of a job.</p>
<p>A week ago, he had done a rash thing. One of the
friends of his married days&mdash;still, supposedly, a friend
of Edyth&rsquo;s&mdash;had seen him in crowded Summer Street,
rushed up to him and said that she must have some
money. Her husband had failed to meet her with it as
he had promised, her bags were waiting in the South
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
Station for a week-end she was spending on the Cape
with friends, Neil must give her every cent he had on
him and probably that wouldn&rsquo;t be enough! But would
he hurry! He <i>had</i> hurried. He pulled his roll from his
pocket&mdash;Saturday was pay day&mdash;and pushed it into
pretty, smart Joyce Clayton&rsquo;s yawning snakeskin purse.
His only thought during the act was gratitude that the
woman was in such a tearing hurry that she seemed not
to notice his wordlessness. It was his pride that none of
that crowd should know how things were with him, and
until this meeting with Joyce, success had seemed childishly
easy; they hadn&rsquo;t bothered. But as Joyce had rolled
off in the taxi into which he had put her silent&mdash;and she
not noticing his wordlessness&mdash;she had leaned out and
called back, &ldquo;Your address, Neil darling! For heaven&rsquo;s
sake, what is it? I&rsquo;ll send a check to-morrow.&rdquo; He had
smiled, raised his hat and blotted himself out from her
eyes in the crowds of Summer Street. When he discovered
that he hadn&rsquo;t even any loose change in his
pocket and must walk back to his room supperless and
even put off breakfast until he could borrow at the works
on next week&rsquo;s salary, he was not much concerned. He
had some chocolate in his room and plenty of cigarettes.
The chocolate served for supper and breakfast, and the
few dollars he let himself borrow on Monday kept him
fed until Wednesday, when&mdash;instead of asking for more&mdash;he
walked out penniless an hour after getting to the
garage. There would be no more wages to ask an advance
on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>He walked over to the Common and sat on a bench all
morning, doing what he described to himself as face the
situation. But every little while he stopped looking into
the ugly face of his predicament and tried to speak. If
he could only even whisper! He tried to say his own
name. He tried it dozens of times but the only result
was the ghost of a sob.</p>
<p>When the noon bells and whistles sounded he came,
before they ceased, to a determination. He would look
for work&mdash;yes&mdash;go into machine shops and garages
with pencil and pad in his hand, and offer his services.
He would face down all the curiosity and jeers that
would come to him for his inability to speak. He would
scour Boston for any sort of job where speech was not
essential. But he would not go to any one to borrow
money for food. If he got a job, O.K. If not, starving
would be a natural way out and nobody, not even his
guardian angel, could call it suicide.</p>
<p>Neil had followed what seemed to him this fair plan
with action. Hungry, he had job-hunted steadily, until
Friday morning. Friday morning, in the pursuit of the
impossible job, he had stumbled, in a dirty alley, on a
little abandoned paper bag half full of peanuts. Yes,
it seemed too good to be true; and indeed he was by this
time in such a giddy state that it might very easily be
illusion. He had not been sure it wasn&rsquo;t, until he had
them in his teeth. Then, as he threw the bag from him,
empty, Neil remembered that to-morrow his room rent
would be due. But something else about Saturday was
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
important too. After some groping he remembered&mdash;an
appointment with Doctor Pryne.</p>
<p>Doctor Pryne! The handful of peanuts seemed only
to have increased his hunger. Good luck, stumbled upon
so astonishingly, had weakened his will, he thought;
but anyway, he would ask Doctor Pryne for the loan of
a dollar. Then he would buy himself food. He would go
now and get the money. With meat and coffee to back
him up, the Saturday&rsquo;s s&eacute;ance must work&mdash;<i>Doctor
Pryne must cure him.</i> Anyway, it would be Neil&rsquo;s last
shot before letting himself starve. There was some chance
it might work. Pryne was always holding out hope&mdash;always
seemed expectant of the thing&rsquo;s breaking. But
even if it didn&rsquo;t work, and the cure didn&rsquo;t come through
on Saturday, and consequently he never got another job,
and starved, and so never paid back that dollar,&mdash;<i>Pryne
was a good fellow.</i> Neil would rather be owing Doctor
Lewis Pryne a dollar through eternity than any other
soul he knew. He&rsquo;d give himself that one more chance.</p>
<p>So he had walked the miles up to the doctor&rsquo;s office
on the strength of the peanuts. And a new girl in the
reception office&mdash;only she looked like something in a
fairy tale, and almost as illusory as the peanuts&mdash;had
said Pryne couldn&rsquo;t possibly see him till his appointment
the next day.</p>
<p>What he had done between then and his return just
now a little ahead of his appointment time, Neil could
not have told&mdash;or written. The one thing he knew,
knew constantly, was that he had not eaten.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>Now as his groping heel found the rim of the dark,
and his left hand reached for the door knob, Neil was
grateful that after all he had not seen Doctor Pryne
yesterday. Now, as it was, he would be taking no debt
to this man over the ultimate doorsill; for, in this moment
of confusion, the hours the doctor had spent on
him, for which he could never now send a bill, did not
loom as debt in the young man&rsquo;s aching brain.</p>
<p>His fingers had the door knob. It was cold and they
were hot. Neil exulted in the knowledge that one movement
of his arm, and this door would go shut forever
and ever between himself and Doctor Lewis Pryne&mdash;Doctor
Lewis Pryne who had let him down to a girl
with a fairy-tale face in a violet dress with a yellow
belt....</p>
<p>If it had been Lewis who had moved and spoken, the
door would have slammed then and the revolver roared.
But it was Petra. To Neil&rsquo;s shaking vision the fairy-tale
face was flaming&mdash;unbelievably&mdash;to a white flame of
angelicness&mdash;was becoming an angel&rsquo;s face, against
which no door could shut. The blue eyes were swords.
The violet, the yellow were gone, and all her clothing
was winged white fire. Fear that was awe and awe that
was fear paralyzed him. She&mdash;white fire&mdash;was coming
upon him&mdash;</p>
<p>Lewis had put out a hand to drag her back. But to that
hand Petra was not spirit nor flame. She was solid young
muscular strength, breaking loose from his clutch. Before
he had got around the desk, she had reached the
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
boy, her arms were around his neck, her face lifted to
his, which did not bend to it&mdash;only the eyelids were
dropped so that he still saw her angelic fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neil McCloud, you&rsquo;ve got it all wrong. Doctor
Pryne forgot to lock his files and I came snooping in
here and read your cards. That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;ve found us
talking about you. Doctor Pryne is ready to <i>kill</i> me for
it. And I ought to be killed. But the friend I told&mdash;she
will keep your secrets. Truly she will. Or she will tell
them only in her prayers! It is the Little Flower she is
especially telling. She is offering a novena to her for
you&mdash;a novena to Saint Th&eacute;r&egrave;se of Lisieux. Do you
know the Little Flower? Teresa, she has the Little
Flower&rsquo;s name herself, you see&mdash;wants you to say &lsquo;I
love.&rsquo; She said last night, &lsquo;Love is the Word. He must
say that.&rsquo; She asked the Little Flower to help you say it.
Say it now&mdash;Neil McCloud. Try to say, <i>I love</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis was close to them. Petra was wild, mad. But
no madder than McCloud. If the boy lifted a hand,
Lewis was ready. He had guessed about the revolver.
He would snatch Petra back, get between them, if the
man moved a finger. Then a strange thing happened.
Up in McCloud&rsquo;s face, Petra&rsquo;s face seemed to be reflected&mdash;or
rather a flame, a flame burning to whiteness
that couldn&rsquo;t be Petra, after all. It was an unearthly wing
of light. McCloud put his hands up to Petra&rsquo;s hands
that were clasped on the back of his neck&mdash;but Lewis
did not stir&mdash;and took them down; but he kept them,
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
as if he did not know he had them still. He was not even
looking at Petra now&mdash;but beyond her.</p>
<p>Neil said, &ldquo;The Little Flower? Yes, of course, I know
her. The kid had a special devotion to her. Mother had
too. The kid thought he saw her&mdash;his First Communion
morning. In his room. By the washstand. Mother believed
him. She had an idea he might be a priest some
day. But he won&rsquo;t grow up now. He&rsquo;s dead. The little
fellow is dead.... How does the Little Flower feel
about that&mdash;my killing him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t kill him. It was a fault, not a sin, when
you took him flying. Teresa says so. But see! The Little
Flower has cured you, no matter how she feels. She has
answered Teresa&rsquo;s prayers.... Even without your saying
&lsquo;I love&rsquo;! Your speech is perfect&mdash;you have spoken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Until Petra called his attention to it, Neil had not
known that he had spoken. But it was true. His voice still
hung in the room&mdash;he heard it now in echo&mdash;the warm,
unstrained voice of young manhood. It was his own
voice!...</p>
<p>He let Petra&rsquo;s hands go then. He backed up against
the door jamb to his full exultant young height. His face
was rolling with tears, but it could not be called crying.
There was no grimace of the features and his eyes were
wide open. His hands were at his side. He spoke again:
&ldquo;I love. My God, I do love. I love You, my Lord and
my God. Have mercy on me, a sinner.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<h2 id="c15"><i>Chapter Fifteen</i></h2><div class="img"><img src="images/ch.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="30" /></div>
<p>The elevator for which Lewis had rung brought
Dick Wilder up with it. Until he saw him there, Lewis
had totally forgotten that he would be coming along
about now to keep his date with Petra.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he exclaimed, taking Dick&rsquo;s arm and pushing
him back into the elevator cage ahead of himself.
&ldquo;Come on down with me. I&rsquo;ll explain in the street.
Petra&rsquo;s busy just now and can&rsquo;t possibly get away.&rdquo; And
by the time they had walked out through the lower hall,
come to the sidewalk and crossed to the curb where
Dick&rsquo;s car was parked, Lewis had decided how much&mdash;how
little, rather&mdash;he would tell Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Petra&rsquo;s doing something very special for me,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Helping with a patient. Interruption would spoil the
whole thing. You&rsquo;d better wait here in your car till she
comes down. I&rsquo;ll stick around with you for a few minutes,
if you&rsquo;ll have me; then I must get back and see what
she&rsquo;s accomplished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how long will she be?&rdquo; Dick asked, puzzled.
&ldquo;Not long, I hope. We&rsquo;re a little late already. Featherstone
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">177</span>
kept me, talking over a commission that came in
this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes? Well, Petra mayn&rsquo;t be able to leave for half
an hour or so. But does it matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but see here, Lewis! She can&rsquo;t be half an hour&mdash;or
anything like it. God! Do you expect me just to sit
here in this heat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; Lewis&rsquo; anger blazed. It was too soon after
that other voice, McCloud&rsquo;s, new-found, racked with
love, had uttered the Name&mdash;and Lewis could not bear
it. But after all, Dick had not been there. He could not
know how shocking was the sound of his casual expletive.</p>
<p>So, quickly contrite for the injustice of his anger,
Lewis exclaimed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m edgy, I think. It is
blistering, isn&rsquo;t it!&rdquo; Lewis was decidedly not edgy and
moreover, for some time now, ever since he had invited
Petra out of the reception office to sit in the patients&rsquo;
chair, facing him, he had not been aware of the heat.
But it was the only explanation of his mood he cared
to trust Dick with, at the moment. And his friend accepted
it as reasonable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo; Dick turned off Lewis&rsquo; apology,
embarrassed, then added quickly, &ldquo;But look here. I&rsquo;m
taking the Farwell family to the Meadowbrook Country
Club for dinner. And there&rsquo;s a tea party at Green Doors
first. Very special! In honor of little Sophia&rsquo;s second
birthday. Her grandmother is coming&mdash;Clare&rsquo;s mother.
No one else. Clare&rsquo;s counting on Petra, of course. Why,
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
she&rsquo;ll be terribly disappointed if I don&rsquo;t get Petra there
in the shortest possible time now. Do you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis did see, perfectly. Again Petra was to be forced
into the role of baby-snubber. Only this time it was his,
Lewis&rsquo;, fault.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A pity. But what Petra is doing
now is even more important than two-year-old birthday
parties. Take my deepest apologies to Mrs. Farwell, will
you please, and tell her that I was tiresome and unreasonable
and that Petra had nothing to say about it. Do that
and I&rsquo;ll drive her out myself&mdash;get her there in time for
your dinner at the latest. I promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Lewis, old-timer, I can only say that it seems
to me you&rsquo;re taking a funny way to help Petra learn how
to treat Clare. I don&rsquo;t see how anything can be quite so
important as you&rsquo;re making this out to be. Really! If
Clare forgives you, she&rsquo;s an angel. But she will, of course.
She <i>is</i> an angel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s reassuring. But seriously, Dick, it&rsquo;s none of
my business how Petra treats her stepmother. Thought
I&rsquo;d made that plain. As a matter of fact, though, and
just from the outside, she seems to me to be playing her
part at Green Doors rather well.&mdash;If you aren&rsquo;t going
to wait, you&rsquo;d better get along and explain, hadn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose I had. Clare can&rsquo;t keep little Sophia
up, of course. Somebody must be there before the cake
and the candles to explain about Petra and help make a
party. But be sure to get her out in time to dress for
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">179</span>
dinner, won&rsquo;t you! Where will you dine yourself, Lewis?
At the Allens&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. It doesn&rsquo;t matter.... Cynthia&rsquo;ll think I
have a Meadowbrook complex for sure, if I turn up
three times within the week!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last was spoken to himself as he stood on the
curb, watching Dick&rsquo;s car nose out and creep away in the
traffic. Lewis would give Petra and McCloud another
ten minutes before returning to his office. He went across
to the Public Garden in the hope of finding an empty
bench where he could smoke while waiting that ten minutes.
But he wondered, as he went, what Dick would
have thought, could he know how Lewis had left Petra
occupied up there,&mdash;if he could see her, as Lewis had
seen her from the door before he closed it softly. Dick
would, of course, think him quite mad. But he was not
mad. Lewis knew himself as sane&mdash;and as collected&mdash;as
he had ever been in his life.</p>
<p>McCloud, after his declaration of love, had walked
past Petra and Lewis, not seeing them any more, and
dropped on his knees by the patients&rsquo; chair. There he
had put his head down in his folded arms on the leather
cushion. Lewis himself had stayed where he was, inert
and doubtful of what to do. As a psychiatrist, he had no
cue for further action. But Petra felt no hesitation. She
did not even so much as glance at Lewis for approval of
her intention when she quickly followed McCloud, and
quietly seating herself on the arm of the patients&rsquo; chair,
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
put her hand down on his dark head. After that, there
was no sound or motion in the place.</p>
<p>... Petra&rsquo;s eyes met Lewis&rsquo; through the stillness.
He smiled his slight, fleeting smile&mdash;a smile that declared
both his gravity and his comprehension. Then he
got out of there, leaving Petra alone with McCloud, as
quietly as he could. McCloud, when he returned to common
day, had better find himself with Petra than with a
psychiatrist. It was his best chance&mdash;Lewis was certain&mdash;of
hanging on to the liberty he had regained, over the
first minutes of difficult adjustments.</p>
<p>Lewis found his vacant bench in the garden and lit a
cigarette. A squirrel, boldest and most insensitive of all
animals to the moods of humans, came rollicking up to
his feet. A motion picture of a squirrel&rsquo;s gyrations, slowed
down, ought to be excitingly beautiful. Lewis had long
intended to buy a moving-picture camera for the one
purpose of taking organic life in motion,&mdash;flowers opening,
horses trotting, unconscious children playing. But
so far he had not had the price,&mdash;not been willing to
give it, anyhow. At this very minute the clinic was in
crying need of a new ceiling. If he didn&rsquo;t scare up the
money for that and set them to work on it, the plaster
would be coming down on people&rsquo;s heads. You couldn&rsquo;t
wait for the hospital trustees to get around to vote the
money. The psychological effect of such dinginess was
bad for the patients too....</p>
<p>The Little Flower! Saint Th&eacute;r&egrave;se of Lisieux! It was
precisely as if a friend of some of Lewis&rsquo; best friends had
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
stepped in between him and his patient this afternoon,
curing the patient. For the Little Flower was no far-off
legend-enshrouded figure in Christian myth. She was of
modern times. She had died, in fact, a girl then of
twenty-five, only half a dozen years before Lewis was
born. His mother&rsquo;s contemporary! And in dying she had
asked the privilege of spending her heaven doing good
upon earth; and since then countless miracles had been
credited to her interventions. Joseph Duffield, Lewis&rsquo;
one greatest friend, had had, during the last few years
of his life, what he in his Catholic terminology called a
special devotion to this particular saint. Joseph had
died, as it happened, midway in a novena he and his wife
were making to the Little Flower for the cure of his
angina. Strangely, her husband&rsquo;s death and the unhealing
grief it had brought her had not shaken Laura Duffield&rsquo;s
faith in the Little Flower&rsquo;s loving goodness. There was
even now a framed picture of the Little Flower on the
bookcase in Laura&rsquo;s bedroom where she had moved
Michael when he fell so ill. Lewis had often looked
across the suffering, paralyzed little form during his long
watches this past week, and himself taken heart from the
pure smiling face of the young saint.</p>
<p>Michael, too, knew Th&eacute;r&egrave;se and loved Th&eacute;r&egrave;se best
after Mary and Joseph of all the saints his grandmother
had taught him to reverence. The boy had told Lewis
that first night he spent with him in his rooms, that he
had begged the Little Flower&mdash;begged her over and
over&mdash;to make his grandmother well again, right up
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
until his separation from her at the clinic that afternoon.
And when that did not happen, Michael had gone on
praying and loving Th&eacute;r&egrave;se all the same, as soon as the
first spasm of homesickness passed a little. Laura Duffield,
when Lewis had remarked on this persistence of
the boy&rsquo;s faith in this particular saint, had smilingly said
that to her mind that was one of the Little Flower&rsquo;s favorite
miracles, preserving and even increasing faith in
the hearts whose dearest desires she could not, in God&rsquo;s
mercy, answer.... It was the miracle beyond miracles,
Laura had said, this increased love and faith in the face
of denial. Didn&rsquo;t Lewis himself see that?</p>
<p class="tb">The squirrel was now actually on Lewis&rsquo; knee, begging
with nose and paws and eyes for nuts. But Lewis looked
through the avid little beggar as through a bit of glass.
Shock of some sort&mdash;he had made up his mind to that
weeks ago, hadn&rsquo;t he!&mdash;was the best hope of restoring
McCloud&rsquo;s speech. The only question had been how to
procure a shock that would not be calamitous. Well, this
afternoon, McCloud had had his shock. Two of them,
in fact, one right on top of the other. First, the most
violent sort of anger at finding his doctor betraying his
confidences. Second, Petra&rsquo;s reminding him with such
unexpected suddenness of the Little Flower&mdash;a person
intimately connected with the brother for whose death
McCloud held himself responsible. It was possible even
that &ldquo;the kid&rdquo; had spoken Saint Th&eacute;r&egrave;se&rsquo;s name while
dying. In any case this afternoon had shown that she
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
was all bound up with memories of &ldquo;the kid&rdquo; in McCloud&rsquo;s
tortured mind. So there were the two shocks,
either one of which might easily account for the cure.
Lewis admitted the possibilities. But all the same, he was
not convinced of the rational explanation. Nor was he
exactly convinced of the supernatural explanation. He
simply felt no compulsion to decide between them. Who
was he, to dare to say!</p>
<p>One thing only was certain. The McCloud records
should be abstracted from the files at once and burned;
for no psychiatric theories, no pages for a new book,
would ever be forthcoming from this particular case.
That was Lewis&rsquo; only certainty.</p>
<p>The squirrel sprang away as Lewis got up. The ten
minutes he had given Petra and McCloud alone together
must be up. He threw away his cigarette and went back
to the office building.</p>
<p>The door into his reception room was locked. That
was surprising. Lewis remembered, distinctly, that the
latch had been off when he came out. It was always off,
in fact, until the place was finally shut up for the day.
He got out his latchkey, wondering.</p>
<p>The rooms were deserted. No Petra. No McCloud.
They had both gone. But surely Petra had interpreted
Lewis&rsquo; final look at her before he closed the door to
mean he would be back almost at once. She must have
known he would want to keep McCloud in his care for
the next few hours. Why, he had left his hat there on
the desk even, and his papers lay scattered. Petra could
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
see, if she couldn&rsquo;t reason, that he was coming back.</p>
<p>He looked his desk over, thinking she might have left
a note of explanation for him. But she had not even done
that. Then Lewis thought he understood. She must suddenly
have realized that Dick was very late, called the
architect&rsquo;s office, found that Dick had left it some time
ago, decided that he was not, after all, coming for her,
and dashed for a train. But where would McCloud have
gone off to, so quickly, without a word, or a note? His
room, most likely. Quickly Lewis looked up the address.
There was a telephone number, but Lewis dared not
submit the stability of the young man&rsquo;s cure to such a
drastic test. So he started off in search.</p>
<p class="tb">A little after seven o&rsquo;clock Lewis was back in his own
rooms in the apartment hotel where he lived. He had
waited in his car outside McCloud&rsquo;s rooming house for
something over an hour, watching for McCloud&rsquo;s return,
after first making sure he was not already at home.
Then he had dined in anxious solitude in a humble
restaurant and now he was here to telephone Green
Doors. He got Dick, but only to discover that Petra had
not come on the train, hadn&rsquo;t showed up at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you promised to bring her yourself, I thought!
We&rsquo;ve been waiting. Clare was delighted. She wants you
to join our party at the Club. She called your office the
minute I told her your plan about driving Petra out. But
nobody answered. How do I know where Petra is, if
you don&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>Lewis explained&mdash;but it sounded stupid in his own
ears&mdash;that he and Petra had missed each other somehow
and she had never learned that he <i>was</i> driving her
out to Meadowbrook. She must have taken a train. Please
would Dick have her call Lewis at his rooms here the
minute she came. It was important. Yes, Lewis would
wait in for the call.</p>
<p>After that, there was nothing Lewis could do but wait
and try to read, or work on the book. He would read.
He wished he had installed an electric fan this summer.
It had been the expense, again, that had deterred him.
But this was a most oppressive variety of heat. Not a
breath. Extraordinary. You didn&rsquo;t often get nights like
this so close to the Atlantic. A good thing he hadn&rsquo;t let
Cynthia hang curtains at his windows. Every particle of
air that could come in was here in his curtainless rooms.
Lewis took &ldquo;Phantastes&rdquo; down from his bookshelves and
settled into a chair against one of the windows to read.
He had hesitated between &ldquo;Phantastes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Saint
Augustine&rsquo;s Confessions,&rdquo; and finally chosen the former.
His recent talk with Cynthia on the subject of Petra was
the deciding factor.</p>
<p>Eight. Half-past eight. Quarter to nine. Dick must
have forgotten to tell Petra to call, that was all. They
would be just about finishing dinner at the Club now.
Lewis would make himself wait until nine, to make
certain not to interrupt Dick&rsquo;s dinner party, and then
call.</p>
<p>This time he asked for Miss Farwell herself, but if she
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">186</span>
was not there then Mr. Richard Wilder. It was Dick who
came, and with promptness. &ldquo;Yes, just finished dinner.
I was right here by the boxes, going to call you. Petra
hasn&rsquo;t showed up. Clare wants to speak to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor Pryne? Good evening. I&rsquo;m really rather anxious,
you know. What&rsquo;s become of Petra? Where is she?
Dick doesn&rsquo;t seem to have got it quite straight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Clare knew Teresa Kerr&rsquo;s whereabouts, Lewis
would have asked her for the address then and there,
in spite of the taboo Petra had imposed on mentioning
Teresa to anybody at Green Doors, for of course it had
occurred to him that Petra must have taken McCloud to
see Teresa. If she was living in Boston. It was she,
Teresa, who had prayed for his cure to Saint Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.
It was she who had understood that McCloud could say
&ldquo;I love.&rdquo; But Clare, Lewis was sure, knew nothing of
Teresa Kerr&rsquo;s present existence. So he merely said, &ldquo;The
whole thing is due to my stupidity. We missed somehow,
Petra and I. But I am sure she is all right, that there&rsquo;s
nothing to worry about. Only please ask her to call me
the minute she does turn up, will you. I am waiting in
to talk with her. Here at my rooms. Thanks so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis had been sincere in his assurances to Clare that
Petra was all right and that there was no cause for anxiety
on the part of her stepmother. Lewis&rsquo; only real
anxiety at that time was about McCloud. He wanted to
know whether the cure had lasted; and it seemed hard,
having merely to sit here and wait for that information
until Petra called him up. He grew more certain as the
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
evening wore on that she had taken him to Teresa and
that they were there now. The McCloud business had
simply put Green Doors and all her social obligations
right out of Petra&rsquo;s mind. You could not wonder at that.
Lewis&rsquo; own mind had had room for nothing else since,
in spite of his pretended reading of many pages, already
thrice familiar, of George MacDonald&rsquo;s &ldquo;Phantastes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave up even the pretense of reading now and
started pacing his sitting room. It was a large, long, low
room, almost bare of furniture. The partitions joining
three rooms had been knocked out to make it. The two
things Lewis demanded of his living quarters were
spaciousness and absence of unessentials. So this sitting
room of his&mdash;to which he had let Cynthia do nothing&mdash;was
rather like a very large, beautifully proportioned
cell,&mdash;except for a grand piano at one end set between
corner windows. This was a beautiful rosewood instrument,
beautiful in itself as a vase of flowers or a fire on
a hearth. And it was heaped with stacks of musical scores.
Lewis read music for diversion as other people read
books. Sometimes he played to his reading&mdash;ghostlily,
for his mind alone. But whether his hands gave him back
the sounds he read as ghostly echo or not, he usually did
his music-reading sitting at the piano as if he were playing.
The instrument itself, even when he was not touching
the keys, seemed in some inexplicable way to enrich
his comprehension of the scores. Bach and Brahms were
the masters he consorted with most, but he often turned
to C&eacute;sar Franck as well, and understood him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>Above the piano between the windows, Lewis had
hung a picture, framed in narrow black wood. It was
about a foot square, no more, and the only picture in the
room. Three trees, done in ordinary pencil. The first
impression was of meaning and beauty. The lines of the
trees and the grasses at their roots flowed upward with
an ineffable sweep of freedom. Even the trunks were
fluid. That was the first strong impression. But if one
looked again, came nearer, one was surprised at oneself
for having seen it as full of meaning because now one
guessed that here was but another modernistic performance,
seemingly careless, yet (if one was given the grace
to understand it) tremendously sophisticated&mdash;a production
of the very latest moderns. Then if one stayed
on there, trying to regain one&rsquo;s first genuine thrilling
response to loveliness, one saw better: now the upward
fluid sweep of the trees&rsquo; living lines was pure unaffected
copying of what some fresh, pure vision had seen. A
child! It was a child&rsquo;s drawing.</p>
<p>It was, indeed, one of little Michael Duffield&rsquo;s drawings.
If Michael kept this way of <i>seeing</i> (for that was
what his drawing was now, pure <i>seeing</i>) through the
rapids of adolescence, where so much is torn apart and
swept away as well as so much gathered together and
added to in the make-up of the psyche, Michael would
be one of the masters. A great artist. Lewis was certain
of it. Meanwhile, this one drawing was enough for Lewis
to possess, of the hundreds Laura Duffield so carefully
cherished. When the piano was silent and the musical
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">189</span>
scores were put away, it filled the room for him with
perpetual music.</p>
<p>Lewis stopped his pacing. What sense was there in all
this miserable anxiety, when trees rose up out of the
earth, like that, fluid, peace in their flowing boughs! He
went to the piano bench&mdash;opened Brahms&rsquo; Rhapsody
in G-minor&mdash;smoked and read, read and smoked.</p>
<p>It was after midnight when the telephone rang in the
bedroom. He was there almost before the second ring
had started, sitting on his bed, lifting the instrument
from the table by the pillow. He knew it must be Petra.
&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Lewis speaking.&rdquo; Not Doctor
Pryne. At midnight, after two hours with Brahms, one&rsquo;s
surname is a thing of peculiar unreality, impossible to
speak seriously. Hence his &ldquo;Lewis speaking.&rdquo; But there
was silence on the wire. For a breath there came no response
to his announcement of baptismal selfhood. So
he spoke again, with an almost fantastic presumption,
into the night at large, &ldquo;Petra! Are you there....
Petra?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<h2 id="c16"><i>Chapter Sixteen</i></h2><div class="img"><img src="images/ch.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="30" /></div>
<p>Out of the dark, out of the invisible, Lewis got his
response: &ldquo;Yes, this is Petra. I hope you hadn&rsquo;t gone to
sleep. They said you wanted me to call you. I&rsquo;m sorry
it&rsquo;s so late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. No, I&rsquo;m still up. But look here,
Petra, of course I want to know about McCloud. What
you did with him. How he is.&rdquo; And then Lewis could
not help adding to that, &ldquo;Petra, have you only just got
home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the brief silence. Because of the hour, the stillness,
and all the Brahms in which Lewis was steeped,
the stillness on the wire took on the proportions of a
cosmic stillness. Or was she only hesitating between
fabrication and fabrication&mdash;between stories to tell him?
If he could only see her face, he would know.</p>
<p>Finally, &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve just come in. Clare waited up for
me. I&rsquo;d forgotten to telephone her, you see; I put it off,
and then forgot it. I worried them, I guess. But it was
Neil&mdash;made me forget. Yes, he is all right. He was
starving, Doctor Pryne. Friday, when he came to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">191</span>
office, he was starving. He lost his job early in the week.
He came Friday to borrow a dollar for food. Teresa and
I have been feeding him up. He&rsquo;s coming around to-morrow
to talk with you, at your hotel, at ten o&rsquo;clock....
Is that all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had paused before the question,&mdash;afraid, apparently,
that she might a second time have made a mistake.
Lewis was appalled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Petra! Starving! This is a bad business. Where
is he now? Do you mean he hasn&rsquo;t money to buy meals
with? What about his breakfast to-morrow morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I loaned him some money, all he would take.
He&rsquo;s gone back to his room. He thinks they&rsquo;ll trust
him for the rent until he gets a job. He&rsquo;s perfectly sure
he&rsquo;ll get a job, now, you see,&mdash;now that he&rsquo;s all right,
you know. He&rsquo;s terribly confident. He&rsquo;s going to try to
sell cars again. He says he has a knack for that....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say you and Teresa fed him.&mdash;Teresa&mdash;&rdquo; Lewis
stopped. But surely now the barrier was broken
down! Teresa was no longer to remain a mystery. For
after all, Lewis and Petra and McCloud and Teresa were
now linked together by the twist fate had taken this day.
But Petra did not catch the implications of his tone and
his hesitation. She offered no further details of the evening&rsquo;s
doings. Where they had fed the starving man,
what they had fed him, and Teresa&rsquo;s part in it all, were
not forthcoming. &ldquo;Is it all right about to-morrow at ten?
That Neil should come to see you then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. I wish he had come to breakfast, though.
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
I wish you had waited till I came back, this afternoon.
Why didn&rsquo;t you, Petra?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Teresa said, that we should have waited.
But when I found that Neil was <i>hungry</i>&mdash;everything
else went out of my mind. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear! You have nothing to be sorry about. You&rsquo;d
better be rather satisfied with your day&rsquo;s work, I should
say! I hope your family understand that your not turning
up for the birthday party was&mdash;was not your fault in
any way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petra lowered her voice to answer that. It was almost
a whisper. Lewis suspected then that she was afraid that
her end of this midnight conversation might be overheard.
Clare had waited up for her. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t really
explain anything much about it, Doctor Pryne. You see&mdash;he&mdash;Neil&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t
want any one to know about&mdash;about
what&rsquo;s been happening to him. He cares a lot that
nobody should know. So I just said it was work for you&mdash;my
job&mdash;that kept me away, and that it had to be
confidential. But Clare&rsquo;s upset&mdash;a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.... I&rsquo;ll write your father a note tomorrow
morning, Petra. I&rsquo;d better. He will make your
stepmother understand. But I&rsquo;m sorry it was unpleasant
when you got home....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind that. Clare wasn&rsquo;t cross. Only hurt,
you know. But the evening&mdash;well, the evening has been&mdash;lovely.
We&rsquo;ve had a wonderful time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>We&rsquo;ve had a wonderful time!</i>&rdquo; The words and the
lilt in them echoed over and over in Lewis&rsquo; head, forbidding
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
sleep. He told himself it was the oppressive heat
of the night which held him awake, his eyes open on the
dark. At least, he told himself that in the beginning.
After an hour or more of restless tossing, however, Lewis
admitted the truth. It was Petra&rsquo;s happy, excited voice
saying &ldquo;<i>We&rsquo;ve had a wonderful time</i>&rdquo; that was making
the very idea of sleep fantastic. The words and the new
tone in which she uttered them opened vistas to Lewis&rsquo;
imagination. It was absolutely inevitable in the light of
to-day&rsquo;s happenings that McCloud should&mdash;<i>worship</i>
Petra. How could he fail to! Only an imbecile, given
the situation, could help it. McCloud, of course, was no
imbecile. And Petra&mdash;how would she respond to the
fellow&rsquo;s idolization! Now that Lewis was at last face to
face with the prophetic misery which was keeping him
wakeful, he went on with it&mdash;followed the train of
thought which he had, in his attempted self-deception,
dammed up, while he tossed and blamed the stuffiness of
the night.... McCloud was a gorgeous person. Gorgeous
was a cheap adjective ordinarily, but in this one
instance, it was the right adjective. McCloud&mdash;let Lewis
face it, see it&mdash;was a gorgeous creature, not only physically,
to look at, but in inward ways as well. Directness,
simplicity and courage. Those qualities make for gorgeousness
in a man. How could Petra, after to-night, fail
to see McCloud as godlike? Why, her very share in
bringing him back to life&mdash;for wasn&rsquo;t that practically
what she had done?&mdash;would add to her sensibility of
his splendor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind. The evening&mdash;well, the evening
has been&mdash;lovely.</i>&rdquo; Lewis laughed audibly. Why should
she mind! Why had he ever thought she might, and
been concerned about it? How should a stepmother&rsquo;s
annoyance tarnish such a meeting and recognition as had
come into Petra&rsquo;s life to-day! The very tone in which
she used McCloud&rsquo;s Christian name showed how things
had gone between them.... Neil and Petra.... &ldquo;My
God!&rdquo; said Lewis into the dark. &ldquo;Neil and Petra!
Was it foreordained?&rdquo; He felt a powerful impulse to
communicate further with Him of whom he had so
spontaneously asked the bitter question. He turned over
and buried his face in his crossed arms. But he did not
know how to go on with the Contact&mdash;did not know
how to pray. Lewis had been born into the tradition that
formal prayers which one has by heart have no functioning
quality. One must make up one&rsquo;s own prayers, for
originality is the only guarantee of His creatures&rsquo; sincerity
the Omniscient will recognize. But Lewis doubted
this proud notion now, as he lay here, facing down into
the dark, helpless with the anguish of loss. If only there
were patterns: sweet, fluent channels of accustomed
prayer, through which one could pour one&rsquo;s blind groping
toward fortitude and peace! What was it McCloud
had said to God in Lewis&rsquo; office this afternoon? That
was prayer, certainly,&mdash;even though not uniquely and
strikingly the boy&rsquo;s individual invention. &ldquo;God have
mercy on me a sinner.&rdquo; Yes, that would do. &ldquo;God have
mercy on me a sinner.&rdquo; Lewis uttered the ancient unoriginal
<span class="pb" id="Page_195">195</span>
cry-of-all-souls with stark sincerity to God imminent,
God transcendent, and added to it, after a long
sweet stillness, &ldquo;It is Your justice. Why did I think
Petra was for such as me? Your justice is Your mercy,
Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the morning Lewis seemed to remember that peace
had flowed into the channel his prayer had cut through
his dark with a rushing benediction in a sound as of many
waters. Peace. Then sleep.</p>
<p class="tb">In the weeks that followed, Cynthia Allen gradually
came to admit to herself that she had had all her worry
for nothing about Lewis&rsquo; untoward infatuation for an
uninteresting young girl; for the affair&mdash;if one could
give anything so fleetingly ephemeral such a title&mdash;had
blown over. She had been silly even to imagine it serious.
A person like Lewis, so subtle, so perceptive, could not
long be held in thrall to mere physical attraction and
youth, with nothing to give it depth. No, Harry had not
succeeded in convincing Cynthia of the ineptitude of
qualifying passion with &ldquo;mere.&rdquo; Harry was a simple soul,
really, in everything except finance. You could not expect
him to understand a man like Cynthia&rsquo;s famous
brother. Lewis was all intellectual subtlety. First of all,
in any contact, he would look for understanding and
depth. Passion, when it appeared, would be a by-product
of the discovery of his ideal. He was like Anodos in
&ldquo;Phantastes&rdquo; in that. Cynthia was sure of it. He was not
common clay!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>For weeks now Lewis had not come out to Meadowbrook.
That was hard on the children and on Harry.
They were so devoted to him. But Cynthia herself was
not the loser. She frequently met him in town for lunch,
where she had him much more to herself than she possibly
could in the midst of the family. And it was fun
gossiping with him, her interesting brother, in undomestic
freedom, giving him innumerable anecdotes of
the children, telling him what Harry thought of the
financial situation between the countries, and in our own
country, and of what she herself thought of the latest
selections of the book clubs. Cynthia subscribed to all
the American book clubs and had recently added an
English one to the list.... And sometimes, always in
fact, she slipped in gossip of Green Doors; for Green
Doors and its inmates fascinated Cynthia increasingly.
The life there&mdash;the people who came and went&mdash;the
parties, the talk&mdash;all of it was just a degree above anything
Cynthia had ever experienced before of sophistication
and a &ldquo;newer, larger liberty of thought and feeling.&rdquo;
The air was electric. She remarked on it often.</p>
<p>Why, even Petra now interested her, rather, and had
taken her place as part of the general fascination of all
that made Clare&rsquo;s life so dramatic. For Petra was having
a romance; and all the world loves a lover&mdash;at least
when no relations are involved. It was that attractive
young Irishman, Neil McCloud. Petra had picked him
up somehow, all on her own, without anybody&rsquo;s help, it
seemed. Cynthia&rsquo;s curiosity as to the precise how of that
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">197</span>
had never been satisfied, exactly. But he was forever at
Green Doors these days&mdash;followed Petra around like a
faithful dog&mdash;literally. If they weren&rsquo;t engaged, it was
obvious they were the next thing to it. Perhaps they were
engaged and were refraining from mentioning it until
Edyth Dayton McCloud should return from Switzerland
with a divorce in her pocket. Cynthia often imagined
to herself&mdash;and with some enjoyment&mdash;how the snobbish
Daytons were going to feel when they woke to the
fact that the husband whom Edyth had so casually jilted
was marrying Lowell and Clare Farwell&rsquo;s extraordinarily
beautiful daughter. Cynthia imagined that the wedding,
when it came, would be at Green Doors, outside, on the
terrace or lawn; for Clare had no use for stuffy churches
and organized religion, although she was more religious,
Cynthia was sure of it, than most so-called pious people.
Clare lived her religion without any pretense. She would
plan a beautiful wedding. It was pretty wonderful of
her, too, to take Neil McCloud in as she had done, without
apparent question or hesitation. Petra liked him.
Petra admired him. That was enough for Petra&rsquo;s stepmother.
She was ready to like and admire him also. But
it was only good luck and no special credit to Petra&rsquo;s
discrimination, Cynthia felt, that nobody could help liking
the man. He was a perfect darling.</p>
<p>To-day Lewis himself had taken the trouble to call
Cynthia up and ask her to dine with him. And he was
being very generous and extravagant, for him; he had
brought her to the New World Hotel, the best dining
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">198</span>
room in the city. It was almost the middle of August,
the end of a summer that had been the warmest in
Boston&rsquo;s weather record. Lewis was beginning to show,
Cynthia saw, what the strain of the vacationless summer
in the city had been. There was a perpetual white line
around his mouth, two dark hollows in his forehead, and
he was certainly thinner. But&mdash;bless him&mdash;he appeared
to be as interested in herself and her chatter as ever, and
as alive to all her interests. About himself and his work
he had nothing to say except to tell her, when she asked
about it, that his new book was all but finished. The last
set of proofs, in fact, would go to the publisher within
a few days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s grand,&rdquo; Cynthia congratulated him. &ldquo;All&rsquo;s
well then and the goose hangs high?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;The goose hangs high.
They&rsquo;ve already started arranging in Vienna for the
translation. I&rsquo;ve let Mendel have it. I&rsquo;ve quite a nice letter
from him about it. Came to-day. If he comes over this
fall, and he must, I think, may I bring him to Meadowbrook?
I should like him to meet you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cynthia was thrilled, naturally. Between her famous
brother and Green Doors, her life held all sorts of potentialities
these days. It was fun having interests outside
and a little beyond mere &ldquo;Society,&rdquo; with all its
futilities!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody told me Mr. Malcolm Dayton has come
to you for treatment,&rdquo; Cynthia said, suddenly remembering
it. &ldquo;Clare told me, I think. Not Petra. She&rsquo;s as
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">199</span>
secretive with me about office affairs as if I weren&rsquo;t your
sister. Is it true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Lewis answered. He was always a little short
when she questioned him about his patients. Cynthia
never got used to it nor quite understood it. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;d
Mrs. Farwell get such a notion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was waiting for Petra. In the reception office. She
said he came in while she was there. She was interested,
of course, on account of Neil. Very much interested, as
you may imagine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh? But yes, I remember. He wanted to see me
about a personal matter. It was a damned interruption in
office hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it about Neil?&rdquo; Cynthia was curious almost beyond
bounds. And it would be gratifying to have some
really interesting news to take to Clare. &ldquo;Has old Dayton
tumbled to the situation? Does he know Neil&rsquo;s fallen on
his feet&mdash;in the inner circle at Green Doors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. At least, I don&rsquo;t know anything about what he
knows or doesn&rsquo;t know about his son-in-law. Certainly he
didn&rsquo;t mention McCloud to me. He wouldn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s to be
hoped he doesn&rsquo;t even know McCloud came to me for
treatment. It&rsquo;s Dick Wilder&rsquo;s fault that anybody knows
it. He saw him here one day and then meeting him at
Green Doors he remembered. That&rsquo;s how you know, my
dear Cynthia, and the Green Doors crowd. Petra never
told. No, Dayton wanted my ideas on something in connection
with a new charity he is starting. That, too, was
confidential.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry! I didn&rsquo;t mean to be prying, darling. But I
hope he doesn&rsquo;t know about Neil and Petra. He might
get dog-in-the-mangerish feelings and stop the divorce
going through. I&rsquo;m not often so hateful, but I rather
hope that Edyth is going to see what a fool she has been,
too late. Why, from her, you&rsquo;d think Neil was the veriest
bounder. Clare says so, anyway. Edyth had filled Clare
up with stories. Now Clare doesn&rsquo;t believe a word of any
of it. She never happened to see Neil, or she wouldn&rsquo;t
have believed them before, she says. But how she detests
Edyth! Now more than ever&mdash;although she has
always seen through her more or less. I always liked
Edyth myself; though now, of course, I can see what
Clare means about her! It&rsquo;s nice Neil makes money so
easily, isn&rsquo;t it, in these times! He sold Harry a car last
week&mdash;on the very day when Harry said we simply
had to begin economizing. A joke on Harry! We have
no more need of a third car than&mdash;than you have,
Lewis! But after Neil had talked a few minutes, Harry
thought life wouldn&rsquo;t be life without it! He&rsquo;s a super-salesman,&mdash;must
be. Clare is wonderful about the whole
thing. She says they&rsquo;re bound to be happy if Petra goes
into it open-eyed. Petra must realize, though, Clare says,
that Neil is the type always to have affairs. Nobody so
stunning-looking, so amusing and good-natured, can help
it. But also he is the type&mdash;if Petra&rsquo;ll only be a little
understanding&mdash;who&rsquo;ll be reverential to his wife and
simply adore his children. All Petra will need to manage
him will be a little adroitness. That&rsquo;s Clare&rsquo;s only
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">201</span>
worry about it&mdash;that Petra won&rsquo;t know how to manage
him. Why even now&mdash;before he&rsquo;s got Petra safely for
his, he flirts with Clare herself&mdash;absurdly&mdash;under
Lowell&rsquo;s very nose. With me too. But nicely, you know.
I&rsquo;m rather thrilled and I love seeing Harry glower!
Petra&rsquo;s a lucky girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis had decided that he wouldn&rsquo;t have dessert, after
all. Only black coffee. He&rsquo;d begin drinking it while
Cynthia had her ice, if she didn&rsquo;t mind. He&rsquo;d have a
second cup with her when she came to it. He had some
work he had to do to-night later. Lots of coffee was
necessary. He had brought some English Ovals along
for Cynthia. Yes, truly. Would she have one now&mdash;or
wait?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He&rsquo;s a type who&rsquo;ll be reverential to his wife and
simply adore his children.</i>&rdquo; Petra the wife, Petra&rsquo;s the
children. Why, now, after weeks of mental self-discipline
and grim philosophizing&mdash;and nightly prayer&mdash;did
such a remark have the power to rock Lewis&rsquo; very being
in agony?</p>
<p>Cynthia was eating what she considered a particularly
delectable ice. Too bad Lewis didn&rsquo;t want his. &ldquo;But
there&rsquo;s one thing may spoil the whole show,&rdquo; she went
on. Her chatter to-night was tireless! &ldquo;It looks almost as
if Dick himself is getting serious about Petra. Remember
your asking me why he didn&rsquo;t, weeks ago? And I said,
how could he? Well, he seems to be like most men&mdash;let
another male admire a woman and they begin to think
there may be something in her. Men act like sheep in
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">202</span>
their erotic adventures. I don&rsquo;t know whether Clare has
noticed it. But if she has, she probably isn&rsquo;t bothering.
Dick needs some one quite different from Petra&mdash;a
younger Clare. He is so utterly a product of super-civilization.
While Petra and Neil&mdash;there&rsquo;s something
untamed, unaccountable, about both of them. With Neil
it&rsquo;s his Celtic blood, I s&rsquo;pose. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if
Petra&rsquo;s mother was Irish. Those blue eyes! Are you interested
in all this chatter? Lewis, <i>I&rsquo;m boring you</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Cynthia. I&rsquo;m not bored. Only it&rsquo;s all so futile. I
didn&rsquo;t know you and your friend Clare had those two
already married. Haven&rsquo;t either of you remembered that
Neil is a Catholic? His marriage to Edyth Dayton was
confirmed by a priest. No matter how legal a divorce she
gets, so far as McCloud is concerned, he is married to
Edyth as long as they both live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&mdash;But if Edyth can be free, why can&rsquo;t Neil? He
never mentions anything religious. I don&rsquo;t believe he
gives it a thought!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not. I don&rsquo;t know anything about that. But
if your surmise is true, it is only temporary. In his heart
McCloud would feel that any marriage he contracted
now was no marriage. Whatever his plunge into Clare&rsquo;s
circle has done to him, it won&rsquo;t&mdash;in the last analysis&mdash;change
his Catholic heart. At least, I don&rsquo;t see how it
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Lewis! Surely&mdash;surely you aren&rsquo;t so&mdash;why, I
don&rsquo;t understand! You wouldn&rsquo;t have a man like that
go <i>unmarried</i>! He&rsquo;s just the sort to go to the devil&mdash;if
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">203</span>
he hasn&rsquo;t ties. Of course he will marry again. If not
Petra, some one else. He&rsquo;s bound to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis had good hold of himself now. He said, &ldquo;No
one is bound to be disloyal to the truest thing in him.
Any more than he&rsquo;s bound to be loyal to it. We&rsquo;re
creatures of free will. But if McCloud does use his free
will toward the destruction of his new-found integrated
self, I hope that it won&rsquo;t be Petra who is the instrument.
I&rsquo;m very fond of Petra, as it happens,&mdash;deeply fond
of her; and to see her ruin any man&rsquo;s life&mdash;I simply
can&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s all. No matter what tragedy this means for
them both, I hope they don&rsquo;t go so far as a marriage
pretense. Now I&rsquo;ve told you my ideas on the subject,
let&rsquo;s forget it. It&rsquo;s really their affair, not ours. But somehow
I&rsquo;m putting my faith on McCloud&rsquo;s integration
saving them both from inevitable misery. Petra&rsquo;s doing
awfully well at the office, by the way. Losing her
would be no joke!&rdquo; ... He ended on something which
Cynthia, taking it at its face value, considered a laugh.</p>
<p>But though she let the sound pass as a laugh, Cynthia
looked at her brother rather keenly. Had she been
wrong? Was he still attracted by Petra himself? She
shrugged it off. No, she was not wrong. Mere physical
attraction wasn&rsquo;t going to twist Lewis&rsquo; fine, important
career out of shape, wasn&rsquo;t going even to worry him for
a minute. She was happily sure of it.</p>
<p>It was true, what Lewis had just said of Petra&rsquo;s work.
She had made herself invaluable in these long, hot, trying
weeks, both to him and Miss Frazier. She could take
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
dictation now, if given a trifle slowly, and when Lewis
and Miss Frazier were both working under pressure,
they sometimes even left letters unread for Petra to
sign. And in the reception office people trusted her and
liked her. They liked her even to the point, it seemed,
of not minding being put off by her. This was a blessing
in itself, since putting off people was one of the chief
functions of her job. Just her voice over the telephone
seemed to have the power to salve wounded feelings and
instil resignation in importunate patients.</p>
<p>Lewis had taken her out to lunch several times during
the summer, getting in his bid ahead of Neil or Dick.
But those intimate hours afforded no reprieve from his
loneliness for the real Petra. Those hours t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te
over little tables turned Petra and Lewis into strangers.
Although Lewis never accepted Clare&rsquo;s eager invitations
to parties and intimate teas at Green Doors, and met
Clare only by accident at times when she came up to the
office ostensibly to see Petra, Petra still considered him
Clare&rsquo;s friend, not hers. She clung almost passionately to
that assumption. Lewis knew no way of breaking it down.
Her stubbornness in this one matter was equalled only
by her reticence. And since their midnight telephone conversation,
she had never spontaneously brought Teresa
into the conversation once. To his own tentative and
diffident suggestions, she had always the same answer,
&ldquo;If she asks me, I will take you to see her some day. But
not just now. She is&mdash;very busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So paradoxically their casual contacts in the office were
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
better, more satisfying, than any planned t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;tes.
When he stopped by her desk, going out to lunch or
coming back, Petra might tell him of some comical incident
that had come up during the morning in her gracious
sphere, the reception room, and they would chortle
over it in good fellowship. But sometimes she seized the
opportunity to plead somebody&rsquo;s case with him. To-day
she had done that. Wouldn&rsquo;t he please give Mrs. Jack
Loring more attention? It was so special, so pitiful,&mdash;the
thing she wanted his help with. Wouldn&rsquo;t Lewis at
least talk with Mrs. Loring about it? Lewis had not
minded taking the time to explain to Petra&mdash;standing
by her desk, looking down into her lifted, serious eyes,&mdash;that
this particular committee worker was hysterical,
and hopelessly sentimental, as well as outrageously interfering.
Children were better off&mdash;he expounded it at
some length, just to stay there near Petra&mdash;better off
in degraded homes than in public institutions. But he
would promise to do something in his own way, leaving
the meddlesome social worker out of it, if he found that
anything could be done without violating ordinary human
rights to privacy.... It was at such moments as
this that Petra was herself with Lewis and that something
real was regained&mdash;and retained for as many
precious minutes as it lasted&mdash;of their first intimacy on
the edge of the June meadow.</p>
<p>But suddenly Petra had looked past him, in their
whispered colloquy this afternoon, and smiled. McCloud
had come in and was waiting until &ldquo;the boss&rdquo; should
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">206</span>
leave off and Petra be free for him to take for a noon
spin in the glittering, swanky, sports roadster which, as a
salesman, he had at his disposal. Looking from one to
another of them in that minute, Lewis had been impressed
more profoundly than ever with how alike they
were. The eyes were the identical shade of blue. Such a
terribly intense blue! They might be brother and sister.
Or first cousins. But it was always startling,&mdash;as freshly
and poignantly startling, every time he saw them together,
as if he had never before noticed it. And they
were both so vibrantly young! Tall, long-limbed, wide-shouldered,
strong-chinned&mdash;and then again that intense
blue of their eyes! They might be Siegmund and
Sieglinde in love, and above the incest-taboos of mere
mortals, belonging to each other by their very resemblance....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lewis, you look ghastly!&rdquo; Cynthia broke into her
brother&rsquo;s swift lapse into revery, shattering it with her
concern for him. He was grateful. It was not very easy,
seeing Petra give to Neil what she had once seemed to
give to himself&mdash;and then withdrawn&mdash;with such
adamant mysteriousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do. Simply ghastly! You&rsquo;ve put off your vacation
too long this year. When are you taking it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s why I got you in to-night, to tell you.
I&rsquo;m taking a little one right away. Going off to-morrow.
With Dick. Down to Mount Desert. We&rsquo;re starting early
in the morning. I&rsquo;m driving. We&rsquo;ll be there several days.
Sailing. Climbing. Dick&rsquo;s in some sort of difficulty. Something
<span class="pb" id="Page_207">207</span>
he wants to talk over, anyway. And it&rsquo;s a good time
to go. I can take the proofs with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, need you? Don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s too silly, on a vacation!
But then it&rsquo;s too silly to call it a vacation, anyway&mdash;a
few days! Yes&mdash;I&rsquo;ve seen myself Dick&rsquo;s worried. But
why doesn&rsquo;t he confide in Harry or me&mdash;or Clare? Why
does he think he can spill it all out on you&mdash;you of all
people&mdash;who have altogether too much of this talking-it-all-out-stuff
in your daily grind! It&rsquo;s pretty inconsiderate
of him, I think. Clare&rsquo;s wise, capable of complete
detachment, and besides all that, utterly devoted to the
creature. I suppose it is sympathy he wants. Or perhaps&mdash;I wonder&mdash;is
he all snarled up over Petra? If he is&mdash;Clare&rsquo;s
certainly the person to hash that over with!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis said, &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t believe Dick has anything on
his mind that has to do with Petra. Why do you put
that idea into my head, Cynthia? If I had thought it was
that&mdash;but it isn&rsquo;t&mdash;I&rsquo;d have gone alone. Cynthia, you
are the world&rsquo;s prize idiot. Do lay off prying and finish
your coffee. It must be stone cold. How does Harry abide
you! If you start crowing here, they&rsquo;ll put you in jail
as a disturber of the peace. No, you can&rsquo;t have another
cigarette. If I&rsquo;m going in the morning, I&rsquo;ve got to get
back to work now. It&rsquo;s fun getting you furious in a position
where you have to consider your dignity. You&rsquo;re really
quite sweet, all bottled up like that, but foaming around
the cork. Come along, sweetheart. Let&rsquo;s get going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>People turned to look at them as they left. Their
conversation had been far too animated for husband and
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
wife. No, it was romance, it must be. But how distinguished
they were! It was always interesting, dining at
the New World! You might catch a glimpse of anybody
there. It was cosmopolitan and very chic for Boston.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<h2 id="c17"><i>Chapter Seventeen</i></h2><div class="img"><img src="images/ch.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="30" /></div>
<p>Lewis had anticipated three or four days of sailing
among the islands about Mount Desert to the tune of
blue sea, blue sky, white clouds, whitecaps, and the salt
wind over all. But an unprophesied nor&rsquo;easter did its
best to ruin the holiday. The sky was clear when they
started from Boston in Lewis&rsquo; car (Dick had been unselfish
in letting it be Lewis&rsquo; car rather than his own)
and it stayed clear until they were within sight of the
island. Then suddenly the wind changed and every aspect
told them that they were in for a likely three days
of drifting fog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will have to be golf and walking, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; Dick
apologized for his island. &ldquo;This is rotten luck. And we&rsquo;ll
have to use all the tact we can muster in dealing with the
Langleys. They will be humiliated beyond words!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Langleys were the married couple, Yankees and
native to Mount Desert, who lived on the Wilder estate
in Northeast Harbor and were in charge of the place the
year around. The elder Wilders for years past had spent
most of their time in Europe, returning for a few weeks
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
each winter to their Brookline home, but coming down
to their Mount Desert estate almost never. It had tacitly
become Dick&rsquo;s responsibility and playground. Each summer
he entertained several house parties here, and often
came alone with some friend, as he was doing now, for
a few days of sailing and climbing. If at his appearance
the weather was not &ldquo;typical&rdquo; the Langleys felt it a flaw
in their hospitality; and his days here with Lewis, Dick
feared now, would be rife with the good couple&rsquo;s reiterated
apologies for the weather&mdash;and all the more insistently
because the guest of this particular visit was so
important a personage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell &rsquo;em you&rsquo;d rather walk than sail!&rdquo; Dick pleaded.
&ldquo;Tell them you know the views so well that it is just as
if they were there for you behind the fog! Tell them
that fog&rsquo;s darned restful and just what you need. You
see, they are really well-informed people, and you can
bet they know all about who you are. You&rsquo;ll have to work
hard, right at the beginning, to put them at their ease,
or they&rsquo;ll be so chagrined they&rsquo;ll follow us around apologizing
all the time. They will be like parents who keep
saying when the rector calls that their children never
acted up like this before and they simply can&rsquo;t understand
it. You&rsquo;d think they had created Mount Desert and lived
only to display it to me and my guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo; Lewis laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed that
most Mount Desert folk are like that, other years. The
first time I came down here, do you know, I couldn&rsquo;t see
any farther than my hand could reach, practically, for
<span class="pb" id="Page_211">211</span>
two solid weeks. That was in August too. I wouldn&rsquo;t have
known there were any mountains if they hadn&rsquo;t told
me. But you can imagine <i>how</i> they told me! We were
just puffing away in the old <i>Morse</i>, when the wind
changed and it all came out diamond clear. It was like
the never-never land. I thought then that it was the
finest scenery in the world. Norway itself can&rsquo;t beat it.
I&rsquo;ll tell the Langleys that. I&rsquo;ll tell them how I know it
by heart. We&rsquo;ll see, between us, that they don&rsquo;t suffer
beyond endurance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they drove in at the wide stone entrance gates,
laughing.</p>
<p>It was pretty disappointing, all the same. The sky, the
sea, the mountains were all there, like the next page in a
book&mdash;but a page that has annoyingly stuck. Dick took
it harder than Lewis, however. He had counted on the
sharp clear outlines of this Mount Desert environment to
make self-expression easy. He had got Lewis down here,
really, for the sole purpose of clearing his own mental
and emotional decks of clutter. And the fog, somehow,
seemed now an externalization of that inward confusion.
Having it here, visibly and sensibly pressing in around
him, turned him inarticulate. It was Clare who had
planned this expedition, really. She it was who had
suggested that Dick &ldquo;clear his emotional decks by talking
things all out with Doctor Pryne.&rdquo; But it wasn&rsquo;t
going to be so easy.&mdash;Besides, Lewis wasn&rsquo;t acting like
himself, Dick thought. You couldn&rsquo;t call him morose exactly,
but neither was he particularly exuding sympathy.
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">212</span>
He was abstracted: as if he had his own thoughts&mdash;even
possibly his own worries.</p>
<p>At breakfast the next morning they decided against
golf. Lewis wanted exercise, he said, and how about
climbing a few mountains? Even without the view, he felt
like climbing&mdash;strenuously. So Dick, putting aside his
own silent preference for a morning of golf, started off
as cheerfully as he could manage on a foggy all-day walking
and climbing jaunt with this somehow new and
strange Lewis. The plan was that they should begin
gradually&mdash;Asticou Hill, Cedar-Swamp Mountain, and
then with second wind acquired, traverse the mile-long
ledge to Sargent&rsquo;s top, swim in the pond below Jordan,
and descend the bluffs to Jordan Pond, and a taxi home
in time for dinner.</p>
<p>They left Lewis&rsquo; car at the foot of Asticou Hill, and
started up, thick bars of chocolate in their pockets and
thick Alpine sticks in their hands. Lewis was ahead on
the faint thread of trail, straining his eyes for the cairns
which marked the way. Gray gnomes, these cairns seemed
to him, each as it pierced the fog, toppling forward or
sidewise, beckoning him back from the pathlessness of
foot-high forests of blueberry scrub to the faint footworn
windings of the climb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I planned a house one summer to stand right here,&rdquo;
Dick said, when they came to a giant gray boulder and
automatically halted, leaning their backs against its inviting
side, looking down into the sea of fog that shut
them onto the hill. &ldquo;It was my first completely visualized
<span class="pb" id="Page_213">213</span>
house, really. I was twelve, about. I saw the house as a
sort of a growth out of the hill. The skies came down,
the sea came up, and the doorsill was solid sunlight.
Sometimes I really can&rsquo;t believe it isn&rsquo;t here, it was so
real to me then. But I went farther than architecture in
that first venture. I peopled that house, created a family
to live in it. You needn&rsquo;t believe me, Lewis. I don&rsquo;t expect
you will. But the mother of that family was quite
extraordinarily like Clare Farwell. Looked like her, I
mean. When I first saw Clare, years after, I recognized
her as the woman of my early imagination&mdash;the mother
in that first house of mine. By the way, we are standing
by one of the windows in the bedroom I gave her. The
bedrooms were on the ground floor, you see. The whole
top story was living room&mdash;one huge, spacious apartment,
practically all windows. But wasn&rsquo;t it&mdash;eerie&mdash;about
Clare! Imagining her like that when I was just
a kid! I&rsquo;d never seen anybody like her then. Of course,
I couldn&rsquo;t have. There isn&rsquo;t anybody like her.... Is
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I suppose not,&rdquo; but Lewis&rsquo; response had an
absent-minded tonelessness. Yet in another minute he
asked, his psychological interests stirring, &ldquo;What were
you yourself in that picture, Dick? Or weren&rsquo;t you in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was the middle son of a large family. I remember
you that summer, Lewis. You were down here at Doctor
Montague&rsquo;s with Cynthia. She and Harry got themselves
engaged at Jordan Pond. The second time they&rsquo;d
seen each other! I remember my tutor saying to somebody
<span class="pb" id="Page_214">214</span>
or other that it was a whirlwind affair and he
wondered how it would turn out. The word &lsquo;whirlwind&rsquo;
was what made the grown-up gossip exciting to me and
why I remember it now. An exciting word! But speaking
of Clare, don&rsquo;t you think it is rather thrilling the
way she has managed to express herself in Green Doors?
The firm would be surprised if they knew how little,
really, I put myself into it. But that&rsquo;s good architecting,
as I see it. Something like portraiture. If you see what I
mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis&rsquo; mind was busy with a picture of Dick, a
neglected only child, spending long summers on Mount
Desert with servants and callow young college-boy tutors
while his mother globe-trotted and his father made
money,&mdash;a child stealing off up here to this lonely, wild
hill to plan the ideal house and people it with a mother
of his dreaming and a large family of which he was the
middle member. &ldquo;Do you see what I mean? About
Green Doors? That it&rsquo;s portraiture? Portraiture of Clare?
And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so perfectly what it should be?&rdquo;&mdash;Would
Lewis please come out of his abstraction and
pay attention. That&rsquo;s what Dick&rsquo;s tone said.</p>
<p>Lewis obeyed and answered. &ldquo;But is that quite fair?
Most houses have more than one person living in &rsquo;em.
Green Doors has. If you&rsquo;re going to do portraiture in
your architecting, I should think it would have to be
composite portraiture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly, with some houses. But not Green Doors.
It&rsquo;s Clare who colors everything there, and a lucky thing
<span class="pb" id="Page_215">215</span>
for the others! Have you ever known such&mdash;such simplicity
and utter <i>goodness</i>? Isn&rsquo;t she wonderful! Aren&rsquo;t
you grateful that I have brought you together? Isn&rsquo;t just
knowing her worth all the trouble you&rsquo;ve taken with
Petra? I bet it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, trouble with Petra? It&rsquo;s Miss
Frazier who had to take trouble with Petra just at first,
perhaps. But now she&rsquo;s invaluable to us both, let me tell
you. She has a positive flair for the work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really! I didn&rsquo;t realize that. Have you told Clare?
She thinks it&rsquo;s really a kind of charity on your part,
keeping Petra occupied. Petra herself says you are patience
itself and that she is always doing something
wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nonsense. Or else a form of perverted modesty.
Miss Frazier and I would be lost without her now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick would repeat this to Petra&rsquo;s stepmother, Lewis
hoped. It was something at last, though almost infinitesimal,
of course, that he could do for Petra, who
asked and wanted nothing of him really.</p>
<p>Then Dick fell mercifully silent, occupying himself
by scrawling letters in the sand at the base of the rock.
Lewis began counting the fir-tree tops which pricked the
fog with their pointed spires at irregular intervals down
the hill; for Lewis had acquired a habit, when Petra was
called to mind suddenly, as she had been just now, or
came without being called, as she did all too often, God
knew, of concentrating on the first other thing that came
to hand. Now he counted tree tops. And though he was
<span class="pb" id="Page_216">216</span>
smoking far too much&mdash;he knew&mdash;but to whom could
it matter!&mdash;he took out his cigarette case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clare wanted me to talk to you down here,&rdquo; Dick
said suddenly. &ldquo;Tell you things. But I rather suspect you
know them already. You do, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What she means to you?&rdquo; Lewis asked. He was sorry
Dick had decided to plunge into intimate confidences
exactly at this point. If he would only wait till the fog
lifted&mdash;till the seascape was diamond clear. If a northwester
would only blow! If the weather shifted, Lewis
might be able to listen patiently (which was all Dick
wanted, of course) to his &ldquo;If-you-know-what-I-means,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Do-you-sees.&rdquo; But he was in for it now. Dick had
Lewis cornered just as, in his utter overworked weariness,
he felt the fog had him cornered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, what Clare means to me and what I mean to
her,&rdquo; Dick was saying. &ldquo;I imagine you saw how I felt
about her almost before I saw myself. That day when
I came to your office! And all during the summer it has
gone on getting&mdash;well, more and more so. But it isn&rsquo;t
Clare&rsquo;s fault. She saw things as they were even before I
did and she warned me. She wanted me to go away, for
my own good. She was sane and beautiful about it. Why,
she talked in as detached and clear a way as you could
have talked yourself, Lewis. And all the time&mdash;which
makes her detachment so wonderful&mdash;she herself was
involved in it all, do you see! I don&rsquo;t mean that she&mdash;that
she feels exactly the way I do. She wouldn&rsquo;t. She
isn&rsquo;t like that, anyway. She&rsquo;s too&mdash;unphysical. But our
<span class="pb" id="Page_217">217</span>
friendship means everything to her, all the same. She
says that passionate friendship is actually more involving
than passionate love. Because it absorbs and colors
the imagination, you see. If we were lovers, she says&mdash;as
the world understands the phrase, you know&mdash;why,
we mightn&rsquo;t mean nearly so much to each other as we do
with things as they are with us. But she was ready to
sacrifice this passionate friendship for my sake. She was
afraid I might suffer too much, if it continued. You
mustn&rsquo;t think I am crazily conceited, Lewis, when I tell
you that not seeing me any more <i>would</i> have meant sacrifice
to Clare. I don&rsquo;t understand myself why she cares
for me as she does. The miracle of her caring fills me
with the deepest humility. But she does care. Our being
together so much means everything to her, as it does to
me, only in a different way. And she was ready to give it
up! She said that, quite aside from the suffering it might
bring me, there was always the chance that my caring
so much for her might keep me from falling in love with
some girl I could marry, do you see. And she talked it
all out with me&mdash;quietly, bravely. But I wanted to stay,
of course,&mdash;just so long as I was sure it was not hurting
her, or making her unhappy. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis sighed. Not only Clare herself, but Clare even
heard about, invariably overwhelmed Lewis with the
greatest ennui&mdash;or in happier moments made him
swearing, cursing mad. Just now it was ennui. But he
tried to conceal his weariness for Dick&rsquo;s sake. Dick was
not only Cynthia&rsquo;s husband&rsquo;s cousin. He was Lewis&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_218">218</span>
friend of many years. He had no brains&mdash;certainly&mdash;but
artistic functioning in his brainpan somewhere took
the place of brains, and most whiles made him companionable
enough. So now, after sighing, Lewis said,
&ldquo;Yes, I understand perfectly. But Clare is obviously
right: clearsighted, as you yourself must see. The
friendship is destructive to you while it leaves her unhurt.
You ought to snap out of it. It&rsquo;s no joke, I know,
being head over heels in love with a married woman.
But it does happen. And it&rsquo;s never any good sticking
around and trying to get nourishment on half a loaf. A
clean break is the only self-respecting possibility. Sorry&mdash;but
you asked for it, old-timer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A silence, charged with emotion (another of Dick&rsquo;s
substitutes for brain) moving toward articulation followed.
Then he blurted, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do it, Lewis. One can&rsquo;t
choose to starve. Half a loaf is better than none&mdash;even
if it isn&rsquo;t filling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis&rsquo; response to that was unequivocal. &ldquo;It is not
better. It&rsquo;s just a sweet little hell. Clare gave you the
right dope. Take it from her, if you won&rsquo;t from me. If
you want to salvage your future, stay a long way away
from Green Doors, and snap out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk as if you knew....&rdquo; Dick was looking at
his friend now with as much curiosity as surprise. &ldquo;But
Clare has stopped saying anything about my going. She
put it up to me to decide for myself, anyway. She wasn&rsquo;t
dogmatic and opinionated. Not for a minute! I decided to
stay. It&rsquo;s not <i>that</i> I want your opinion on. I believe, with
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">219</span>
Clare, in the individual&rsquo;s right to decide on the happiness
or the misery he will take for himself.... So I&rsquo;m
staying,&mdash;but, thanks to Clare, with my eyes open.
It hasn&rsquo;t been easy. It is just about what you say&mdash;a sweet
little hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course.... So that&rsquo;s that. Shall we get
going?&rdquo; Lewis picked up his stick and crushed a half-smoked
cigarette under his heel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, wait a minute. See here, Lewis, I want to talk to
you. I can&rsquo;t talk, walking. It was Clare, really, who sent
me off down here with you. And I haven&rsquo;t come to the
point of what she wanted me to tell you yet. That was
only preliminary. Clare has a scheme.&mdash;She thought
you&rsquo;d agree that it was, perhaps, rather a good one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis groaned but selected another cigarette. Another
&ldquo;scheme&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;good.&rdquo; Clare was indomitable. He leaned
back again, his elbows on the rock. They might as well
have the rest of it now, he supposed, so long as they were
messing about in thick fog, anyway. A little more or less
confusion from poor Dick&rsquo;s mindlessness&mdash;what did it
matter! But the next minute Lewis was galvanized into
feeling that it mattered enormously. For Dick had said,
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t go away, you see. And I&rsquo;m not going to. I
couldn&rsquo;t leave Clare, to save my life. Our friendship
(Clare&rsquo;s and mine) has become of such importance to
us both&mdash;yes, Clare too&mdash;that now we see that nothing
in this world could have the power to part us. Least of
all, mere physical separation. We must stay&mdash;passionate
friends. We belong to each other. I don&rsquo;t think you
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">220</span>
can imagine, Lewis, what such friendship can be&mdash;or
what trying to stamp it out of one&rsquo;s life would do to one.
It would be infinitely easier to stamp out a sexual relationship
than such a one as Clare&rsquo;s and mine....
Well, this is her scheme. She thinks it will make it
possible for our friendship to go on being beautiful, even
grow more beautiful, more dynamic. She wants me to
marry Petra. That will make it safer for us both, do you
see? What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The obvious matter was that Lewis had torn his coat
sleeve, a jagged rent, somehow on the rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Langley will mend it for you. She can do a
magnificent mend. But how&rsquo;d you manage it? You were
just leaning&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, just leaning, and hearing the ravings of a
blasted idiot. What are you trying to do? Be funny, I
suppose! But I don&rsquo;t care for that kind of funniness.
You can leave Petra out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick was amazed but not silenced by Lewis&rsquo; violence.
&ldquo;I felt surprised myself at first,&rdquo; he owned. &ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t
so wild as you seem to think. And not a bit idiotic. I like
Petra. I like her a lot. I didn&rsquo;t used to. It&rsquo;s only lately
I&rsquo;ve begun to understand her. She&rsquo;s&mdash;why, she&rsquo;s a stunning
girl, really. And she isn&rsquo;t in love with anybody else,
that I know of. She&rsquo;s not engaged to that McCloud
person, in spite of Clare thinking for a while that she
might be and was keeping it secret, the way she likes
keeping things secret. But now Petra has told me herself
she isn&rsquo;t. And I&rsquo;ve got Saint Paul with me: It&rsquo;s better to
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">221</span>
marry than to burn.... There&rsquo;s the whole Greek idea,
too. Those Greek fellows, of course, weren&rsquo;t faithful to
their wives in the sense that I shall be faithful to Petra.
But the situation was rather parallel, all the same. They
had their intellectual and spiritual friendships with men
or with women not their wives&mdash;and it succeeded. It
was wise and sane. Clare thought you would be sympathetic&mdash;understand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Dick! Prick me and wake me up. This
isn&rsquo;t real. If it is, if I&rsquo;m awake, then somebody&rsquo;d better
advise Farwell to get in a good psychiatrist&mdash;but not
me, thanks. I&rsquo;m out of it. But Clare should be under observation.
You too. You both had better leave Petra
alone. Not that anything either of you could say or do
will even so much as touch her wholesomeness! I&rsquo;m a
fool to get so excited about it. What do you say&mdash;shall
we go back to the car and start for Boston&mdash;or shall
we stick this out till the fog lifts? I&rsquo;m perfectly ready
to go back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<h2 id="c18"><i>Chapter Eighteen</i></h2><div class="img"><img src="images/ch.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="30" /></div>
<p>Dick was in favor of sticking it out. He thought
Lewis madder, if anything, than Lewis thought him,
which had the advantage of evening things up between
them.... And then, halfway down the hill, Dick was
struck by an idea. Was Lewis himself in love with
Petra? Could anything be more probable? Petra was
utterly beautiful. Propinquity too, and all that!...
But why hadn&rsquo;t Clare seen this possibility? Suppose she
had seen it&mdash;. Was that the reason why she had
been so insistent on Dick&rsquo;s telling Lewis the whole situation?
So that Lewis would be forewarned? But why would
not Clare consider marriage between Petra and Doctor
Pryne a very good marriage indeed? Clare wanted the
very best for Petra, Dick never doubted that. Did Clare
think, perhaps, that Petra could never be happy without
a great deal of money? Well, Petra probably couldn&rsquo;t,
and Dick, not Lewis, had the money. Petra was mad
about clothes, lovely clothes. She dressed more interestingly
than any girl he knew. Pretty big of Clare,
with her own indifference to luxury and clothes, to consider
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">223</span>
Petra&rsquo;s different temperament, and have such long,
wise thoughts for the girl&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p>But Lewis was such a grand person! Quite aside from
his fame, his personality was head and shoulders above
any other man Dick knew,&mdash;even Lowell Farwell&rsquo;s.
Oughtn&rsquo;t that personality to make up for Lewis&rsquo; comparative
poverty, even to Petra&rsquo;s rather shallow young
view? Dick, in all humility, should think that it would
and that in a choice between them any girl would
choose Lewis, not himself.... But Clare understood
Petra better, it seemed. It was clever of her not to have
told him that Lewis might be his rival for Petra, but
instead to send them off down here together, where Dick
could find it out for himself. But put yourself in Lewis&rsquo;
place. If you were in love with a girl, and a friend came
to you and told you he was <i>not</i> in love with this same
girl but wanted to marry her all the same,&mdash;how would
you feel? Pretty furious! Just the way Lewis had acted!
Dick wondered that Clare hadn&rsquo;t had as much imagination
for Lewis&rsquo; feelings, as she had had for Dick&rsquo;s own,
and Petra&rsquo;s. Well, Clare loved him and Petra; and
Lewis, after all, was only a respected acquaintance. That
explained it. But it was tough on Lewis, all the same.</p>
<p>As they reached and crossed the wide trail toward
Jordan Pond, Dick felt a new emotion coming to life and
ascending in his heart&mdash;like a skyrocket. Elation! To
win Petra from a fellow like Lewis! To imagine Petra
desired&mdash;and by such a man&mdash;had had the effect of
making her suddenly more desirable to himself. He
<span class="pb" id="Page_224">224</span>
would tell this phenomenon to Clare, when he got back,
quite frankly. You could tell Clare anything. Her detachment
was an exquisite, a consoling thing. If he told
her that Petra, he felt, might in time come to take Clare&rsquo;s
own place with him, Clare would even then keep her
dear, generous detachment. But of course, Dick could
never have any such nonsense as that to tell Clare. No
matter how fond he ever became of his beautiful wife,
Clare would remain as long as he lived, his&mdash;his most
beloved.</p>
<p>Abruptly, Lewis interrupted these forecastings. &ldquo;See
here, Dick, I&rsquo;m sorry I got so hot. But let&rsquo;s make a bargain.
Don&rsquo;t you mention Green Doors again or anybody
in it as long as we are together on this holiday, and I&rsquo;ll
go back now and play golf with you instead of hiking.
It&rsquo;s what you want, I know, and you were merely being
altruistic.... The idea of going on walking, anyway,
doesn&rsquo;t appeal to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really! We can swing around to Asticou Inn and
go back for our clubs, can&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They could and they did. But Dick did not know what
Clare would think of the bargain he had struck with
Lewis. She had expected the two to talk endlessly, to
hash everything over.... Or what had she expected
after all? Dick was no longer so certain. Well, he had
only to get back to Clare, look in her candid, sweet eyes,
to lose this sudden new sense of confusion about what
her motives in getting him to confide in Lewis might be.
<span class="pb" id="Page_225">225</span>
She could and would explain to Dick&rsquo;s complete enlightenment
and satisfaction. She always did.</p>
<p class="tb">That evening Dick left Lewis reading Agatha
Christie&rsquo;s last detective novel by an open fire and
walked into Northeast Harbor alone for their mail. If
Clare had written him yesterday, as she had half promised
to do, the letter would come to-night. All through
the long hours on the misty golf course and ever since,
this expectation of a letter coming to-night had been a
steady undertow to all that went on in Dick&rsquo;s mind. The
entire day had been for him nothing in the world but
a straight path to the letter window of Northeast Harbor&rsquo;s
little post office. The mail was sorted by eight-thirty,
he knew, and sometimes a trifle earlier. But,
taking hold on all the strength of character he possessed,
Dick had determined not to arrive at that window of
dreams one minute before the certain time of half-past
eight. He knew how painful it would be to stand around
waiting, watching the mail being sorted and not absolutely
certain of his letter. Now, as he came down the
village street through the drizzling fog, he saw that the
cars parked near the post office were starting up their
engines and that people with letters and papers in their
hands were coming from the post-office door. And he
walked faster. Whether the thick thugging tom-tom his
heart had set up was delight or anguish, he did not consider.</p>
<p>The window gained, and Dick&rsquo;s turn in the writing
<span class="pb" id="Page_226">226</span>
queue at last arrived, he snatched the little bundle of
letters from the smiling postmistress with a muttered,
blind &ldquo;good evening&rdquo; and turned with it to the counter.
His fingers, shuffling the letters through as he looked for
Clare&rsquo;s hand, were shaking. There were half a dozen letters
for Doctor Pryne readdressed in Petra&rsquo;s script. But
there was nothing for himself. Nothing that counted.
Petra had written him, it seemed. A letter in a fat envelope.
But he was so dulled by disappointment that he
hardly bothered to wonder why she had written or what.</p>
<p>He stuffed the whole bunch into his pocket and returned
to the delivery window. &ldquo;Are you sure there&rsquo;s
nothing else for Richard Wilder?&rdquo; he asked. It was a
childish act, he knew, but he could not seem to help
himself. Obligingly, the, to Dick, faceless automaton at
that fateful window turned back to the letter boxes. She
even thrust a hand up into the Wilders&rsquo; now grimly
empty pigeonhole, pretending to make certain of what
was already a certainty. The look on the man&rsquo;s face asking
the unreasonable question made the gesture, empty
as it was, a human necessity. She came back to her window.
&ldquo;Nothing <i>now</i>.&rdquo; The young woman spoke tentatively,
averting kindly eyes. &ldquo;In the morning&rsquo;s mail
perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out in the fog again Dick had to laugh at himself.
Why did he need a letter so? They trusted each other,
he and Clare. What did passionate friendship mean if
not trust and peace, even in separation! Besides, it was
scarcely sixty hours since they had parted. And he would
<span class="pb" id="Page_227">227</span>
see her in thirty-six more. Lewis and he had decided to
cut their holiday short and return to-morrow, after all.
They gave the weather as their excuse to each other, but
not to the Langleys. It was agreed that the doctor to-night
was to receive an important letter which made
their dashing off necessary. The fact was that ever since
Dick had begun to suspect Lewis&rsquo; feeling for Petra, a
constraint had settled between them which made their
close companionship just now more of a strain than a
relaxation. So day after to-morrow Dick would be out
at Green Doors again. It was unworthy of Clare&rsquo;s beautiful
friendship that he should feel actual written words
from her, which he could keep in his pocket and touch,
a necessity to his sense of assurance of that friendship.
It was unworthy and faithless in him. But letters were
uncanny things! <i>Wanting</i> one so terribly was uncanny
too....</p>
<p>Lewis glanced up at Dick welcomingly as he came in.
The detective story had returned him to a healthy, intellectual
mood. He was accustomed to find this type of
reading as effective as a good game of contract or chess
for keeping one sensible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Christie is O.K., Dick,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You must
read it yourself. It&rsquo;s as good as anything she has done.
I&rsquo;ll be through in half an hour or so and you can have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! I picked up a new Dorothy Sayers as I came
along, at Blaine&rsquo;s drug store. You can have that to finish
the night with. Here&rsquo;s your mail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick had dropped the little pile of letters onto the arm
<span class="pb" id="Page_228">228</span>
of Lewis&rsquo; chair, and pulling another chair up to the
hearth, he sprawled himself into it, eyes moodily on the
fire.</p>
<p>Petra&rsquo;s fat letter to Dick was on the top of the pile. In
his disappointment at not hearing from Clare, Dick had
completely forgotten he had any letter at all. Lewis
picked it up, turned it around in his fingers, looked at
Dick. But Dick was bent forward, poking the fire. He
jumped when Lewis spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This seems to be yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure! I forgot it. Toss it across, will you. It&rsquo;s
a fat one. Funny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Putting down the tongs and leaning back in his chair,
Dick tore the flap open with his thumb, and twisting
around to get a better light on the sheets, began lazily
reading Petra&rsquo;s long letter. Lewis made no pretense of
returning to his detective story or of looking over his
own mail. Petra&rsquo;s handwriting on the envelopes in his
little pile that remained stared up at him ironically. This
was as much as he had of her, or ever would have, he
felt. Her hand readdressing somebody else&rsquo;s letter to
him. Petra&rsquo;s handwriting was stirring&mdash;and Lewis believed
it would be stirring to him even if he did not know
and love and desire Petra as he did. The characters were
consistently round, dear, black and perfectly spaced.
The writer of such a script was scrupulous&mdash;exquisitely
scrupulous&mdash;not to waste one instant of the recipient&rsquo;s
time or energy. It was like Petra&rsquo;s own perfect manners,
visible in black and white. But how arid to be sitting here,
<span class="pb" id="Page_229">229</span>
studying and appreciating the nuances of Petra&rsquo;s agreeable
manners, while Dick was reading her heart; for
Dick had lost his indifferent, lounging attitude when he
began to read Petra&rsquo;s long letter, and his profile&mdash;all
that Lewis could see of his face&mdash;was tense and excited.</p>
<p>Lewis got up hastily, leaving his letters where they
were on the arm of the chair, and went out onto the
piazza. The fog sucked up to him, enveloped him. He
coughed, choked sharply. These Mount Desert fogs
were like no others in the world, he thought, and for
once, it occurred to him that he ought to possess himself
of an automatic cigarette lighter: you couldn&rsquo;t strike a
match successfully out here in this insidious fog. But
cigarette or not, he would not return to the warm fire-cheered
room until Dick had done with that letter and
put it away out of sight.</p>
<p>What would Dick do with the sheets when he had finished
them, anyway? Lewis visualized him tossing them
casually into the fire. Then he visualized himself putting
his own bare hand into the fire and pulling them out!
&ldquo;Am I crazy?&rdquo; he wondered. &ldquo;What is there in her mere
handwriting that stirs me more than the sight of Petra
herself? It is the essence of her personality&mdash;as the voice
is&mdash;only visible.&rdquo; If Petra should ever write himself a
letter&mdash;if such a day ever came&mdash;Lewis felt now that
her handwriting on the envelope would produce as profound
a feeling in him as would her first kiss. He
coughed again. The fog hated him. Then Dick came to
the door, shouting &ldquo;Lewis! Oh, Lewis!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! But I couldn&rsquo;t see whether you were there or
not, Lewis! This heathenish fog! But come along in, do.
I&rsquo;ve got to talk to you. Really!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And back in the room, over by the fire, the men stood
facing each other across Petra&rsquo;s letter. For Dick had not
tossed it in the fire. That had been only a daydream of
Lewis&rsquo; tired, driven mind. The letter lay on a little table,
under Dick&rsquo;s palms, as he stood leaning on the table,
looking down at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;I promised to lay off our
morning&rsquo;s discussion&mdash;Clare&mdash;Green Doors&mdash;all that.
But something has happened.... This letter ...
Petra has written.... Amazing.... It&rsquo;s quite moving
... Sweet.... And I want you to read it. It may
open your eyes to something. It has mine. You may thank
me. What I didn&rsquo;t get around to tell you this morning
was that I had already done it&mdash;proposed to Petra. She
turned me down but I wasn&rsquo;t sure she meant it. Clare
was sure she didn&rsquo;t mean it. Anyway, I meant to try again
when I got back. But now I see Clare was wrong. Petra
did mean it. Will you read this?&rdquo; Dick&rsquo;s face was glowing
with the sheer generosity of the thing he was doing.
&ldquo;Will you read it?&rdquo; he asked again, for Lewis was looking
at him strangely&mdash;blankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would Petra mind?&rdquo; Lewis asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That can&rsquo;t matter. She wouldn&rsquo;t mind if she really
knew you. And I owe it to you&mdash;after this morning. If
we were two men in a novel, old boy, I wouldn&rsquo;t give it
to you, and you wouldn&rsquo;t know right up to the last chapter
<span class="pb" id="Page_231">231</span>
that your girl is yours for the asking. But this is life
and we&rsquo;ll let the suspense of the situation go by the
boards. Read and see what a darned fool I&rsquo;ve been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lews took the letter. The sheets were steady in his
strong, long fingers. Dick lounged back in the chair and
watched his friend with growing uneasiness; for no light
dawned in Lewis&rsquo; serious dark face as he read. That face
seemed, indeed, under Dick&rsquo;s very eyes, to grow thin and
grim with controlled emotion of a sort totally other than
Dick had expected.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<h2 id="c19"><i>Chapter Nineteen</i></h2><div class="img"><img src="images/ch.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="30" /></div>
<p>It was the seventeenth of October. It was also
Petra&rsquo;s birthday; and Lewis had relaxed in his practice
of turning down all Mrs. Lowell Farwell&rsquo;s invitations
and was now driving out to Green Doors to a dinner
party given in honor of the birthday. Himself, Dick and
the Allens were to be the only guests. Neil McCloud had
been invited but was, Lewis understood, not coming.
Lewis suspected that Neil&rsquo;s refusal had been the cause
of Petra&rsquo;s manner to-day&mdash;not a birthday manner exactly.
She had moved about at her work in a spirit of
recollection, but a strained, anxious recollection which no
doubt she thought went unnoticed by her employer.
Lewis had first been struck by it when he asked her who
was coming to her party to-night, and her answer had
been that Neil was not. He had laughed and said, &ldquo;But it
was a list of acceptances I wanted&mdash;not refusals.&rdquo; She
had lifted her eyes to his, at that,&mdash;she was sitting at
her desk and he had stopped by it as he passed through
to his own office to say good morning&mdash;and they had
been blank with a kind of subdued misery. But she had
<span class="pb" id="Page_233">233</span>
answered, &ldquo;Clare tells me that you are coming, Doctor
Pryne. The Allens. Dick. It is nice of <i>you</i> to have accepted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that. I am looking forward to it very much.
My dear, will you accept this present? I&rsquo;ve been days
finding it, and if you don&rsquo;t like it I shall be terribly disconcerted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the detail from the Fra Angelico picture: angels
dancing, and saints embracing in a flower-studded
meadow. A very good print, framed in silver. Lewis had
brought the cumbersome thing under his arm, done up in
brown paper, just as it had been sent to him from the
store. Lewis did not hope, of course, that Petra would
ever know why he had hit upon this particular present.
It seemed inappropriate, perhaps, for a twenty-year-old
girl&rsquo;s birthday present. But to Lewis it meant something
they had once experienced together&mdash;a meeting of souls
where language and explanations are no longer necessary,
where all is unselfconscious joy, camaraderie and fluent
communication between the saints in Paradise. That first
sight of the June meadow behind Clare&rsquo;s guest house,
which Lewis had likened to this picture&mdash;and thought
of Petra and himself as saints, without their crowns to
be sure, and their presence there in the paradisiacal
meadow purest accident&mdash;had remained all summer a
poignant memory. He hoped that Petra would keep this
picture all her life, wherever she lived, and that even
not understanding anything of what it meant to him in
the giving, she would remember him now and then in
<span class="pb" id="Page_234">234</span>
looking at it; and thus his memory would stay alive for
her because of something which stood to him for their
own one brief real meeting and recognition. Let that
same quality of recognition never come again on this
earth,&mdash;still it might yet come in heaven. Perhaps it
only needed their crowns for the consummation of its
promise.</p>
<p>An early frost had followed the unprecedentedly hot
summer, and the trees all along the state highway to
Meadowbrook had been stripped during the past few
days of their flaming foliage. The fields and meadows
stretched away brown and purple, barren too. But the
clouds, like levitated mountain ranges, hung above the
western horizon, blazing with autumn colors, red, gold,
purple, buff. The day had had an Indian summer warmth
over it and to-night the sky promised to be divinely clear
with a full moon.</p>
<p>Lewis had sent Petra home from the office when she
returned from her lunch. &ldquo;Somehow you don&rsquo;t look like
a party to-day,&rdquo; he had said. &ldquo;Lie out in the sun on a
blanket somewhere. It&rsquo;s warm enough. Get rested. This
has been a heavy week.&rdquo; Miss Frazier was away on the
vacation she had insisted on putting off until the book
was actually in print and Petra really had been working
up to the full capacity of her strength and ability.</p>
<p>If Lewis had not packed Petra off early, however, she
would be beside him now in his rushing car, sharing the
beauty of those levitated cloud-mountains along with
him, and the bare tracery of tree branches against the
<span class="pb" id="Page_235">235</span>
mellowed fields. He had had a selfish impulse to keep
her late just to make this drive together inevitable. And
he would have succumbed to his selfishness, had he not a
better plan. Neil was not to be there to-night. Whether
Dick was absolutely out of the running or not Lewis did
not actually know. But Lewis had reached his limit of
passive endurance. He had accepted the invitation because
in the very act of reading Clare&rsquo;s note a few days
ago, tending it, he had made up his mind that he would
go with Petra by moonlight to the edge of that meadow
(October now, not June, but in the moonlight it would
still be Paradise) and tell her how he wanted her. If she
was in love with Neil&mdash;and he knew, of course, that
she was&mdash;it did not matter. He wanted Petra at last even
if she came to him with a broken heart. It had taken Lewis
weeks to reach this depth of humility. But now it was
reached. He had struck bottom in his longing and suffering.
If Petra in youth&rsquo;s scorn of compromises said that
she had nothing she could give him, let it be so. At least,
he would have reached for his star. But if he did not
touch the sky to-night, did not draw it down to him, he
must find Petra another job at once. It was impossible
to have her in his office, feeling as he felt, longer.</p>
<p>At its very least, Lewis&rsquo; proposal would have the
advantage of making Petra see the necessity for her not
going on at his office. She would understand and not be
wounded. And he would find her something even better.
In spite of the &ldquo;depression&rdquo; and Petra&rsquo;s lack of business
experience, he promised himself&mdash;and he would
<span class="pb" id="Page_236">236</span>
promise her&mdash;that she should not be the loser. In fact,
all Lewis honestly hoped of this onrushing moonlight
night was for an understanding between himself and
Petra. A bitter understanding on his side&mdash;since she
was going to tell him that she could not possibly marry
him without loving him&mdash;but on hers illuminating. She
would not go on, after to-night, so dangerously unconscious
of the power of her young beauty and loveliness.</p>
<p>Remembering her letter to Dick two months ago
down at Northeast&mdash;and when had Lewis forgotten it
for a single hour!&mdash;he trusted Petra&rsquo;s ability to face
things squarely, once they were given her to face. She
had a clear, honest mind. She had been clear and honest
with Dick. Lewis would now, to-night, by moonlight,
on the edge of the Paradise meadow, be equally clear
and honest with her.</p>
<p>The car reached sixty-nine on the clear-ahead highway,
and the lines of Petra&rsquo;s brave letter streaked through
Lewis&rsquo; mind with almost a like speed. He knew it by
heart from the one reading&mdash;that brave, dear letter to
another man:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Dick:</p>
<p>I am deeply sorry about the way I treated you last
night. I have gotten up before dawn, Dick, to tell you
how miserably sorry I am. Or I suppose it is really
dawn, for all the east is red and purple. I am writing on
Father&rsquo;s desk in the library. Everybody is asleep. But
I haven&rsquo;t slept. I have been sitting up in bed all night,
thinking of my cruelty to you. You see, this is the way
<span class="pb" id="Page_237">237</span>
it was, Dick. When you kissed me like that, it was really
just as if somebody passing me in the street had kissed
me. I mean it was as unexpected as that. My only feeling
was terror. That is why I struck out like that&mdash;just
as you would in the dark, if something strange were
striking at you. You&rsquo;d strike back. Besides, no one has
ever kissed me before. Not like that, I mean. No one
has ever been in love with me before. And you see, anyway,
I have thought right along&mdash;never thought anything
else&mdash;that you came to Green Doors on Clare&rsquo;s
account. It was Clare you always talked to. I didn&rsquo;t know
you even looked at me. This may seem strange to you,
Dick. Now I see that thinking that was pretty stupid.
You have been shy with me&mdash;just as one <i>is</i> toward
somebody one really loves. Clare has explained it. She
came out on the terrace right after you went. I was crying.
She found out what was the matter. And she showed
me how cruel and stupid I had been. I know now that
it was a great honor you did me in asking me to marry
you, Dick. To love somebody like that and tell them so
and have them do what I did&mdash;strike out at you like
a serpent&mdash;must have been too terrible. The blow on
your face was nothing to the blow on your heart, I know.
But now I am cool and all night I have been thinking.
It isn&rsquo;t just because Clare says so but now I <i>feel myself</i>
how I owe you a deep apology. And I am going to tell
you why, even if I hadn&rsquo;t hated your kissing me the way
you did, I would still have <i>said</i> the same thing, that I
couldn&rsquo;t feel toward you as you do toward me. You
asked me, you know, if there was anybody else. If I
was engaged. I told you no. Well, that was true. Of
course I am not engaged. But now I am going to tell
you something to prove how sorry I am I treated you
as I did last night and to show you how I trust you&mdash;and
<span class="pb" id="Page_238">238</span>
how fond I am of you really, now that I see things
about you and Clare in a truer light than I have been
seeing them. It is this, Dick. I am not engaged, and I
am not likely to be. But I love some one terribly. I
love him the way you love me, I guess. But he doesn&rsquo;t
love me any more than I love you. So that makes things
even between us, Dick, doesn&rsquo;t it? Don&rsquo;t tell Clare this,
of course. Or any one. I have told you to even things
up, and to make you see that if I have hurt your pride
terribly, and been cruel to you, the same thing has been
done to me. All I said to Clare last night was that I
should write to you and apologize and beg you to go
on being friends and not stop coming to Green Doors.
Clare and Father will miss you, Dick, if you stay away,
and believe it or not, I think I shall too. I don&rsquo;t know
how I ever behaved so brutally as I did last night, but
I am always making mistakes and doing terrible things.
Please burn this letter.</p>
<p><span class="jr">Affectionately&mdash;truly&mdash;Petra.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Lewis looked up from that letter, Dick had
said quickly, &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t McCloud, Lewis! Don&rsquo;t think it
for a minute. Anybody can see how <i>he</i> feels about Petra.
She could have him if she wanted him. It&rsquo;s written all
over him. It&rsquo;s you she means, Lewis. You. Nobody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis had said, &ldquo;Damn you, Dick!&rdquo; and then no
more. He had held Dick to their bargain from that
minute, not to discuss Petra or anybody at Green Doors
ever again. He had seen to it that Dick did burn the
letter as Petra had asked. And as it charred and went up
in a hot blaze between the logs, Lewis had not reached
his hand to rescue it. He had clenched his hands instead,
<span class="pb" id="Page_239">239</span>
while his heart burned to a white heat and then withered
into charred nothingness with the letter. In that minute
Lewis had hated Dick almost as much as Clare. What
had they tried to do, between them, to this poor baffled
child! Of course it was Neil she meant. Poor Petra! And
of course Neil did want her every bit as much as she
wanted him. But there was the man&rsquo;s living faith&mdash;the
faith neither Clare nor Dick could comprehend as a
reality&mdash;which stood between him and Petra, forbidding
them to each other.</p>
<p>Only now, after weeks of thinking and watching, had
Lewis come to think that it would be best for both Neil
and Petra if Petra could bring herself to accept half a
loaf from life, and marry himself, if she could care for
him even a little. For she was created and designed for
giving&mdash;for motherhood, wifehood. And Lewis loved
her with such utter abandonment! Mightn&rsquo;t the strength
and truth of his love ultimately force a response almost
in kind?</p>
<p>Lewis had little hope that this was even a possibility.
But he had said his prayer&mdash;Neil&rsquo;s prayer, rather&mdash;the
only one Lewis had ever learned to pray. He was
saying it now, as he drew more slowly into Meadowbrook&rsquo;s
environs. His nephews were expecting a romp
with Lewis to-night before their supper. Then he would
be changing into evening clothes at the Allens&rsquo;, for
Petra&rsquo;s dinner, and would return there to sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he assured himself, driving slowly and more
slowly, &ldquo;I shall lose her forever to-night&mdash;or gain the
<span class="pb" id="Page_240">240</span>
chance of beginning to win her.&rdquo; He had decided to tell
her that he had read her letter to Dick down at Northeast
and how innocent Dick had been in letting him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick, you see,&rdquo; Lewis would say to Petra, &ldquo;simply
thought he was fixing things up between you and me
without making us wait for the last chapter! He thought
in all honesty it was I, not Neil, you meant in that letter.
Of course, I knew better.... But Petra, it isn&rsquo;t broken
hearts that make for ruin and unhappiness in lives. Not
ultimately, anyway. It is broken faiths. Neil stayed away
to-night&mdash;don&rsquo;t you suppose&mdash;because of something
dearer to him than mere happiness. Something more
blessed than happiness.&rdquo; That was part of what Lewis
would say to her. And then, if they kissed&mdash;if she let
him kiss her there to-night on the edge of the Paradise
meadow&mdash;</p>
<p>Well! Lewis&rsquo; hope, though small, pierced his heart
like a sword.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<h2 id="c20"><i>Chapter Twenty</i></h2><div class="img"><img src="images/ch.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="30" /></div>
<p>The dinner was over&mdash;a medley of flowers and
fruit, shining candles, extravagantly imaginative food
(Clare was no gourmand but her cook was a prize), much
banter and some conversation. The cake had crowned it
all. It was a perfectly recognizable model, two feet high
or so, of the building where Lewis had his offices, and
Petra herself, done in violet-colored gumdrops, was
represented on the roof, sitting on a typewriter and surrounded
by twenty minute candelabras each holding five
candles. It was obvious that Dick had conspired with the
cook. Every one was enchanted, but Petra most of all.
&ldquo;What a child she is!&rdquo; Lewis had thought, with a variety
of pang he had never before experienced concerning
this girl. &ldquo;A baby, really!&rdquo; A thousand candelabra of
birthday candles might have gone to the shining of her
eyes, and her cheeks were rosy. She clapped her hands
like a child in a fairy tale ... at least, that is something
children outside of fairy tales seem not to do, clap
their hands when they are suddenly delighted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>But now they had left the dining room and come
through the great hall to a small drawing-room at one
side of the street door. Lewis and his hostess, at any
rate, were there, sitting together on a sofa with ends
curved like a lyre, facing the wide arched doorway into
the hall, their backs to open French doors flooded with
moonlight. Moonlight, dim lamplight, a fire burning on
a white-tiled hearth, roses in silver vases&mdash;that was
Clare&rsquo;s little drawing-room to-night. Cynthia and Farwell
had drifted through the room with their cigarettes
and out the French door to the moonlit road. Farwell
called back as they went, &ldquo;This is delicious, Clare! Your
road is like a silver river to-night. You and Doctor Pryne
must come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Clare by a glance had held Lewis where he was.
She said to him in a low voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather watch Petra!
Isn&rsquo;t she too delightful to-night! This is the way I have
dreamed her. If only all days were birthdays!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry Allen had gravitated to the piano up on the
dais at the side of the great hall, and now he was drumming
out jazz to make your heart jump, while Petra
and Dick danced. They did not confine themselves to
one small space on the floor in the usual way, but circled
the whole hall freely. At dinner Lewis had noticed how
the relationship of these two had changed since he had
first seen them together, that fateful Saturday in June.
Then Dick had only been aware of Petra, it seemed, as
an excrescence on Clare&rsquo;s life. Now they were comrades.
You saw it in the way they looked at each other, laughed
<span class="pb" id="Page_243">243</span>
at each other, teased each other. In fact, they counted
with each other every minute. This was a development
for which Lewis was totally unprepared; for Dick had
kept his promise, and since the fiasco of his and Lewis&rsquo;
holiday at Northeast Harbor had never so much as
mentioned Petra the few times they had met. So Lewis
had rather taken it for granted that Petra&rsquo;s na&iuml;ve and
illusioned letter had destroyed any possibility of an
honest relation between them. From what ground had
the present happy intimacy evolved? Lewis could not
guess. When the cake had been brought in and set on
the cleared table in front of Petra and she had clapped
her hands, Dick who was beside her had kissed her cheek.
It was a brotherly caress, hearty and genuine. But Lewis&rsquo;
heart had stood still. Was this to be the answer? Why
not! How unconscionably unimaginative and stupid he
had been!</p>
<p>Lewis and Clare were in a position to see the dancers
during much of their way around the great hall. But
Dick and Petra seemed not aware of the little drawing-room
and their audience there. They might have been
dancing out under the moon alone, so unconscious they
appeared of anybody&rsquo;s eyes or attention. Dick held Petra
as if she were a delightful glass doll that might break.
And Petra gave the impression of glass. Brittle. Lovely.
Her birthday gown made Lewis think of spun glass, it
was so stiff and fragile. Even her fantastically high-heeled
slippers seemed glassy. And her forehead, leaning
against Dick&rsquo;s bowed-down forehead in the latest
<span class="pb" id="Page_244">244</span>
absurd mode of the dance, added the last aspect of brittle
fragility to what they were doing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Petra and Dick are great friends now,&rdquo; Clare said
suddenly. &ldquo;You can imagine, Doctor Pryne, how that
gratifies me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s very nice.&rdquo; Lewis did not
mind the idiotic sound of his own words. Clare simply
did not count enough for him to listen to her. She was
less than nothing to his consciousness, with Petra out
there in Dick Wilder&rsquo;s arms, turning on fantastic spun-glass
heels to Harry&rsquo;s intrepid, persistent, absolutely
compelling jazz.</p>
<p>Clare was all too aware of Lewis&rsquo; indifference. Nothing
to-night had gone quite as she had planned it. If
she were honest with herself, she would have known
that the imperfection of the way the birthday party was
going really consisted in its perfection. The object of the
party, Petra, had somehow, strangely, unbelievably,
taken the center of the stage and held it. Even for her
father she had held it. Several times, when Clare had
said something directly to Lowell down the table, he
had been slow to turn his eyes from his daughter. And
once he had not turned them at all&mdash;merely answered
his wife absently, while he continued to smile at some
silly byplay between Dick and Petra. As for Doctor
Lewis Pryne&mdash;who sat at her right during dinner&mdash;his
manners were impeccable but his attention, she had
known perfectly well, was for Petra. Even when he was
not looking at the girl&mdash;and to be fair, he scarcely
<span class="pb" id="Page_245">245</span>
looked at her at all&mdash;he heard every silly, childish thing
she said, every laugh,&mdash;heard them through the things
Clare was saying to him. This had never happened to
Clare before. To sit at her own table and have all the
attention sweep over her and away from her toward another.
This was something she had never imagined or
planned! It filled her with a sort of wild unbelief in its
reality. It was dreamlike. Almost nightmarish.</p>
<p>She said now to Lewis, &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they precious. Sweet!
And everything before them! Petra seems to have had
enough of young Neil, or he of her. Anyway, he seldom
comes here now. But it was none of my doing. I was
ready to stand back of him, in spite of my cherished hope
that Dick might find his happiness in Petra. Dick told
you of that hope, at Northeast. So you know how I have
planned and dreamed for both those children, Petra and
Dick. We&mdash;you and I, Doctor, between us,&mdash;seem to
have succeeded in giving Petra her chance at life. Your
job, anyway, has given her self-respect, self-confidence.
And I&mdash;well, Doctor Pryne, you know because you are
wise&mdash;pray Dick never knows&mdash;it has not been too
easy for me to give her Dick. For one thing, honestly, I
am not sure she is big enough for him. I tremble at my
daring in taking her ultimate development so for
granted.&mdash;Tell me&mdash;I need you to tell me, Doctor&mdash;say
that in your judgment I have not been wrong. If I
thought what I have done wasn&rsquo;t to mean Dick&rsquo;s happiness,&mdash;well,
I should blame myself eternally. If in trying
to mend his life I have complicated it&mdash;that is a
<span class="pb" id="Page_246">246</span>
terrible thought. For you know&mdash;he told you&mdash;how
he feels about me. Through no fault of mine. I saw it
happening and I warned him. But I thought if only he
could begin to care for Petra a little, in the end&mdash;in the
end&mdash;well&mdash;he might come to care for me less. He
did tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis sighed. Little he cared whether she heard the
sigh. And she did hear it. He said, &ldquo;If you were actually
giving Dick to Petra so that he might get over his young,
romantic infatuation for you, it would, of course, be
calamitous, Mrs. Farwell. Calamitous for them both.
Ghastly. But that won&rsquo;t be the way of it. If they do
marry, it will be because they have fallen healthily in
love. You&mdash;and I&mdash;we are out of it. Clean out of it.
Nothing to worry us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think Dick no longer cares for me, Doctor
Pryne?&rdquo; Her voice was sharper than she meant it to be.</p>
<p>Lewis did not reply. His hostess or not, she was
abominable. He watched the dancers.</p>
<p>Clare said, after a minute, &ldquo;I see what you think! If
only you were right! How happy that would make me,
Doctor! But life isn&rsquo;t like that. Life makes us suffer.
What I am so tortured by now is the fear that in my
blundering I may not only have failed to help Dick, but
I may have involved Petra in something amounting almost
to tragedy for her. If she cares for him, as she
seems to lately&mdash;if she has given up Neil for Dick, and
Dick fails her&mdash;all our hearts may break in the end.
But mine the most. For I am the cause of the muddle.
<span class="pb" id="Page_247">247</span>
I have wanted only the best for them both. For us all.
And what have I really done! I begin to fear that Dick&mdash;no
matter how hard he tries&mdash;will never be satisfied
with Petra. Knowing Dick, I ought to have known that.&mdash;But
I wanted his happiness so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was crying. Unashamedly. But they were angry,
baffled tears and Lewis knew it. The unkind part was
that Clare knew he knew it. But she would show him.
She would give him a demonstration of how he was
wrong, how absolutely wrong he was. She would show
him that Petra had no possible chance of being her,
Clare Farwell&rsquo;s, rival! After long weeks of fearing it,
to-night Clare was faced with the fact that this Doctor
Lewis Pryne was not to increase her roll of wonderful
friendships. But one slight gratification she would yet
wrest from the humiliating situation: the man might
himself distrust, even dislike her; but he should see that
Dick Wilder was still her slave.</p>
<p>She got up and went to the door: stood by it, one bare,
rather thin arm reached up along the jamb, watching
the dancers. Lewis stayed where he was and smoked his
interminable cigarettes. He was glad his hostess had left
him, but concerned for the direction her steps had taken.</p>
<p>This time, as Petra and Dick neared the arch of the
drawing-room doorway, they could not fail to know that
they were the object of some one&rsquo;s attention. Dick
wavered, let Petra go from his arms, seemed to wake
from a fragile dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to dance, Clare?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But Doctor Pryne is tired of talking to just me.
Come on in and play with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis got up and stood by the fire. Petra came and
stood irresolutely near him, at a loss and waiting for
Clare to lead the &ldquo;play,&rdquo; whatever it was to be. But
Clare wandered toward the French doors and stood, her
back half turned, looking out onto the moonlight road.
No one said anything. Lewis had no intention of &ldquo;playing.&rdquo;
He was swearing angry. Clare turned her head
after a minute&rsquo;s silence, during which the three of them&mdash;Lewis,
Petra, Dick&mdash;had stayed watching her,
turned her head and looked at Dick over her shoulder.
Then she stepped out into the moonlight.</p>
<p>Harry, oblivious that his dancers no longer existed,
that the frail dream had broken, went on pouring out
jazz. Dick had followed Clare, of course. He went as
naturally and with as little fuss as if he were her shadow.
Lewis and Petra were left, silent, by the fire.</p>
<p>Neither of them had a thing to say. The clock ticked,&mdash;an
elegant little glass clock with glass flowers for
dials, on the mantel near them. Then they heard
Cynthia&rsquo;s voice out in the moonlight. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need a
scarf, Clare dear. There&rsquo;s an autumn tang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. The moonlight&rsquo;s warm! We&rsquo;ll be right back.
Get out the cards, Lowell, and since your heart is set on
it, we&rsquo;ll have some poker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But before Farwell and Cynthia came in through the
French doors, Lewis had said quickly to Petra, &ldquo;My
<span class="pb" id="Page_249">249</span>
darling, you mustn&rsquo;t mind. Dick&rsquo;s such a fool he&rsquo;s not
worth your little finger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That brought Petra&rsquo;s face around to Lewis&rsquo;. She took
hold of the high carved back of a chair between them.
Took hold hard. Eyes, lips,&mdash;suddenly they had become
the attentive eyes of her childhood, looking outward
onto a wonder-filled world. The unsullen lips of
her childhood sweetly parted with expectant breath. For
just that instant it might have been Petra back in the
Cambridge apartment three years ago.</p>
<p>But unfortunately Lewis was totally unaware that &ldquo;my
darling&rdquo; had come from his lips at all. He had no cue
to the transformation. And then Cynthia and Farwell
joined them and Farwell was getting out the cards. He
sent Petra for a table. But as she started to obey, she
was intercepted by Elise in the doorway. Petra was
wanted on the telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; Farwell called after his daughter. &ldquo;It
can&rsquo;t be important. Why do you bother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maid answered, not Petra. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t give his
name, sir. But he said it <i>was</i> very important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Elise, don&rsquo;t interrupt us again to-night with
telephone messages or anything else,&rdquo; Farwell commanded.
And then to Cynthia and Lewis, &ldquo;Telephones
are the devil! Damned intrusions on decent privacy!
Clare agrees with me. We&rsquo;re thinking of having &rsquo;em
taken out. As it is, it&rsquo;s a private number, of course, but
Petra has given it to several of her friends. Only natural,
I suppose. But I detest it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>Petra was back almost before her father was done
grumbling. She came only to the door, however, and
said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m terribly sorry, Father, but I&rsquo;ve got a headache.
Elise is bringing the table. I couldn&rsquo;t possibly play.
Tell Clare when they come in, will you? I am going to
bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would have been absurdly impossible to accept illness
as an explanation of Petra&rsquo;s leaving her own birthday
party so suddenly, if her story were not so borne out
by her look. She had lost all the unusual high color of
the earlier part of the evening and become extraordinarily
white and peaked. Cynthia saw it as plainly as her
doctor brother. She cried, &ldquo;Petra, dear child! You must
let me come with you. You do look really ill. And at
your own party! It&rsquo;s a shame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t come, please. I&rsquo;ll be perfectly all right. I
just want to be alone. Will you tell Clare, please, not
to come in, afterwards, to-night? I may be asleep and I&rsquo;d
rather she didn&rsquo;t. Good night, Doctor Pryne. Good
night, Mrs. Allen, and Father. I&rsquo;m so sorry....&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Clare and Dick drifted in a few minutes later,
it was Cynthia who did Petra&rsquo;s explaining. But by then
Harry had waked to the fact that nobody was taking
advantage of his jazz and had come to the drawing-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny!&rdquo; he said, breaking into his wife&rsquo;s account
of Petra&rsquo;s sudden desertion. &ldquo;Petra didn&rsquo;t go to
bed, you know. She went out of the door. I saw her.
That&rsquo;s why I stopped playing. I thought you and Petra
<span class="pb" id="Page_251">251</span>
were dancing, Dick. Then I looked up and saw Petra
going alone out the front door in a tearing hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she have a wrap on?&rdquo; Cynthia asked, concerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Just her pretty party frock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s back now then,&rdquo; Clare said, &ldquo;and in her bed.
It&rsquo;s really cold.&rdquo; But she looked at Lewis, her eyes distraught.
Had the woman any compunction for what she
had done? If not, it was superb acting. She was a Duse,
Lewis thought, but with her genius devoted to personal,
secret dramas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;d better go up and see how she is,&rdquo; Clare
murmured. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t have headaches like this, you
know. Not suddenly. She must have been&mdash;disturbed
about something. Put out. I&rsquo;ll go up. I think she&rsquo;ll come
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; That was Lewis. He did not care how
sharply he spoke. &ldquo;The child really looked ill. <i>And she
particularly asked that you shouldn&rsquo;t go to her.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clare&rsquo;s eyes grew wide,&mdash;darkened. She was superb!
&ldquo;Really? Well&mdash;&rdquo; And then to her husband she said,
with a shrug. &ldquo;And I wanted her party to be a success!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was, my dear. It still is. And Petra&rsquo;ll be all
right in the morning. She doesn&rsquo;t care much for poker,
anyway. Let&rsquo;s start playing. It&rsquo;s going on eleven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Lewis was destined to blame himself, before many
hours had passed, for dissuading Clare from going up to
see about Petra. Afterwards, he never understood why
he had sat there playing poker until midnight, after
what Harry had said of Petra&rsquo;s going out of the door and
<span class="pb" id="Page_252">252</span>
not up to bed. He had been stupid to the point of
imbecility. But the reason was that Petra&rsquo;s transformation
when he told her Dick wasn&rsquo;t worth her little finger,
while she stood holding the back of that chair, had filled
his mind so full of a simply blinding hope that there was
no room for shadows&mdash;hardly for thought itself! He
had accepted her story quite simply, when she returned
from the telephone: she had a headache. He knew, too,
of course, that she was furious with Clare. Any girl
would be, under the circumstances. But for Lewis himself
she had had that look.</p>
<p>It was hard for Lewis to have to wait until morning to
see Petra again. That was all her going to bed in the
middle of the party had meant to him&mdash;that he must
wait now until morning. He was not to tell her his love
by moonlight in the Paradise meadow, but to-morrow,
in daylight, driving her in to Boston. He had got ahead
of Dick in this, and it had been agreed he should come
to Green Doors from the Allens&rsquo; a little before eight.</p>
<p>He won steadily at the game they were playing, but
smiled now and then his lighted smile that had nothing
to do with material, mundane winnings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<h2 id="c21"><i>Chapter Twenty-One</i></h2><div class="img"><img src="images/ch.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="30" /></div>
<p>Cynthia, bless her heart, came down for an early
breakfast with her brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Petra&rsquo;s not over her headache, what will you do?
Make her stay home?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;ll be over it. Miss Frazier&rsquo;s away on
vacation, and I need Petra more than ordinary these
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem a trifle brutal, darling. Don&rsquo;t you believe
the girl had a headache? I do. She looked terrible. I
know Clare didn&rsquo;t believe it, but then she hadn&rsquo;t seen
her. I heard Clare telling Lowell it was temper. I
thought that was rather horrid of Clare, I must say.
And now you are almost as heartless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cynthia Pryne Allen! Do I hear criticism of Clare?
I&rsquo;d better take your temperature. You look all right but
I am afraid you must be delirious!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cynthia leaned back in her chair. She had finished her
grapefruit and black coffee. That was all she allowed
herself for breakfast, having no ambition to compete
with her Harry in avoirdupois.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not criticizing Clare. Not exactly. But lately&mdash;well,
lately I&rsquo;ve sort of come to understand Petra a
little better. I feel as if I have, anyway. I don&rsquo;t think
things are so frightfully easy for her at Green Doors.
Not that Clare means to be unkind. Oh, hardly! But
their temperaments don&rsquo;t jibe, that&rsquo;s all. Clare can&rsquo;t take
it in, that any one can be so simple as Petra is. That&rsquo;s
the trouble, I think. She thinks Petra&rsquo;s simplicity is always
covering some design. But Petra hasn&rsquo;t any design.
She&rsquo;s just a healthy, nice, rather sweet girl. She seems
sweet to me, anyway. Just these last few weeks I&rsquo;ve
grown fond of her. You don&rsquo;t have to wonder where you
are with her, ever. Why, I told Clare just last night that
if I had a daughter I&rsquo;d adore her to be a second Petra.
She&rsquo;d be so <i>comfortable</i> to live with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes? And what did Clare reply, if anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That made me rather cross, Lewis. She said that I
didn&rsquo;t know Petra. She said she was &lsquo;deep.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she mean it as insult or compliment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Lewis! When one woman calls another deep!&mdash;It
has looked to me lately&mdash;nights at the Country Club,
when they were all there together, the Farwells and
Dick and Neil (that simply grand McCloud person, you
know)&mdash;that Clare was almost jealous of Petra. Harry&rsquo;s
got an idea that that&rsquo;s why Neil doesn&rsquo;t come to Green
Doors any more. I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if he&rsquo;s seeing
Petra secretly, somewhere else. I think Clare suspects it
too. She&rsquo;s almost insufferable, anyway, the way she
questions Petra as to where she has been and what she
<span class="pb" id="Page_255">255</span>
has been doing. And she doesn&rsquo;t mind who&rsquo;s there,
listening. It makes one very uncomfortable. It&rsquo;s hateful
for Petra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. One feels that,&rdquo; Lewis agreed. &ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t
worth Petra&rsquo;s bothering about, or yours, really. Clare is&mdash;incorrigible.
All the same, she must have some nice
qualities, I suppose, or she couldn&rsquo;t plan gardens so
astutely, and care about the books she does care about,
and music and all. She does honestly care for those
things. That&rsquo;s not sham. One can&rsquo;t sham that. Do you
know what I think, Cynthia? I think that people like
Clare are so awful simply because they are so close to
being really fine. If Clare were just any silly woman,
&lsquo;out for the men,&rsquo; you&rsquo;d laugh at her and find her,
possibly, rather touchingly human. You might even like
her. But it&rsquo;s precisely because she isn&rsquo;t a silly, superficial
creature that the cruelty and ugliness in her seems such
wretched cruelty, such wretched ugliness. She is an exquisite
person&mdash;has exquisite perceptions, anyway.
There&rsquo;s only that one unpleasant spot, her vanity in the
admiration she excites in every one around her. If she
were only sensual or selfish (openly, healthily selfish, I
mean)&mdash;if she had any mean qualities at all, like the
rest of us&mdash;she&rsquo;d be forgivable. But it is the under-bogging
of all this highly emphasized spirituality with
endless quicksands of vanity that gives a fellow the
jitters&mdash;unless he&rsquo;s sucked under, like Dick, and suffocated
in it. It is obvious that Clare deliberately took
Petra on as handicap to add to the zest of a game that
<span class="pb" id="Page_256">256</span>
was becoming almost too easy to be exciting any longer.
But now that the handicap begins really to weigh&mdash;as
it did last night&mdash;she&rsquo;s lost her poise&mdash;and her pose.
Last night Clare was openly vicious. One could sympathize&mdash;just
possibly&mdash;with her wanting to vie with
Petra for Dick&rsquo;s attention. But when it is in enchanting
and holding Petra&rsquo;s own father she uses the girl as her
foil, I must say I find it revolting. That&rsquo;s vanity gone
rotten. It&rsquo;s better, though, she should show her hand.
It won&rsquo;t do Farwell any harm to see it. He had it coming
to him. I didn&rsquo;t mind seeing him squirm last night.
It&rsquo;s for Petra I mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cynthia almost agreed with Lewis. But she looked
very sorry. After all, Clare Farwell had for several
years made life richer and more significant for Cynthia.
Cynthia was hungry for the good and the beautiful, as
are we all when given leisure to discover ourselves. It
was hard giving Clare up as an ideal. Cynthia took a
brave hold on honesty and justice when she said, after a
painful silence, &ldquo;Probably you are right, Lewis, in all
you say. But I owe Clare a lot. And I&rsquo;m going to try to
stay friends with her and to like her. I mayn&rsquo;t go on
idealizing her as I have. I can&rsquo;t any more. I&rsquo;ve seen too
much, and last night, as you say, finished the revelation.
Any one could see that she was vicious toward Petra.
But I think her friendship for me is genuine. And I shall
try to make mine for her genuine and understanding. I
am sorry for her.&mdash;And now promise me, Lewis&rdquo; (he
was up, ready to be off. It was quarter to eight), &ldquo;promise
<span class="pb" id="Page_257">257</span>
me at least to suggest that Petra stays home to-day.
Couldn&rsquo;t I take her place? I have nothing to do. I&rsquo;d
love it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dear,&rdquo; Lewis said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you know if I
need you. As I said, I&rsquo;m sure Petra&rsquo;s all right by now.
She&rsquo;s a healthy creature. I wish I had your charity,
Cynthia. I need it terribly.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Green Doors had a hushed air. Lewis felt, from the
manner of Elise who opened the door to him, that the
curtain had not yet been rung up, as it were, and that it
was a little unreasonable of him to expect to be let in on
the stage while the hands were still busy shifting scenery
from night to morning. But when he asked for Petra,
Elise&rsquo;s face cleared. Petra, since her job, had become a
worker, one of the hands. Part of real life. If it was only
Petra he wanted, well, Petra could be produced easily
enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t come down to breakfast yet. She ought to
have been down half an hour ago. The cook was just
asking me, was she coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had a headache last night. Perhaps she is not
able to get up. Will you please go and see? Tell her that
Doctor Pryne is calling and that it&rsquo;s all right, he&rsquo;ll go
along without her, unless she&rsquo;s better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis walked back and forth over a space of twelve
of the floor tiles in the great hall while he waited for
Elise&rsquo;s return. He counted them each time. They were
beautiful tiles. Gray-green and glistening with a silken
<span class="pb" id="Page_258">258</span>
sheen. The maid seemed a long time away. But she came
at last, presenting to his expectant and quickly questioning
look a face of blank perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Farwell didn&rsquo;t sleep in her room last night,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Her bed is opened, just as I left it, and her
night things laid out. I can&rsquo;t think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me to her room. Let me see it.&rdquo; Lewis had the
woman by the elbow and was pushing her toward the
staircase. It was as if he had taken in Harry&rsquo;s words about
Petra&rsquo;s not going to bed but out the front door for the
first time. Without a wrap! And Clare had said, &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll
be in bed by now then. It&rsquo;s really October.&rdquo;&mdash;Something
like that, anyway.</p>
<p>As Elise led the way up the stars, Lewis knew,
absolutely, that he had lived through these very moments
before. He knew also that the d&eacute;nouement was
to be a tragic one. He knew beyond this that he and nobody
else in the whole world was responsible and to
blame. There was nothing dreamlike in all this. It was
as if he were more, not less, sensibly conscious than
ordinarily.</p>
<p>Lewis had no hesitation whatever about entering the
room which the maid whispered to him was Petra&rsquo;s. It
was a corner room: two windows on each side. He looked
about on perfect order. Glazed chintz draperies thickly
pleated, like cardboard, were drawn across the window-panes,
pulled there by the maid who had opened Petra&rsquo;s
bed for the night, as a screen for her undressing. Petra
<span class="pb" id="Page_259">259</span>
would have pushed them wide and opened the windows
if she had slept here, of course. The curtains being
drawn, and the windows shut, was evidence that she had
not. Lewis turned to the bed. A pleated spread to match
the curtains had been carefully removed and laid across
two chairs, stiff and unwrinkled. The sheets were turned
down. Across the foot of the bed a white nightgown was
laid out, and down on the floor a pair of high-heeled
mules, gay with pompoms. The dressing table, in one
corner, with its rows of silver and glass-topped jars and
bottles, was in exquisite order. Everything in the room
was orderly&mdash;untouched. Even in his condition of fearful
presentiment of evil, Lewis looked for the picture
he had given Petra yesterday for her birthday. Had she
hung it here in her bedroom, as he had hoped she would?
No, there was a painting by Georgia O&rsquo;Keefe on one
wall,&mdash;a picture Petra couldn&rsquo;t possibly understand.
Nothing else.</p>
<p>Strange to be looking hungrily here for signs of
Petra&rsquo;s personality when Petra herself was lost! Strange
to care that there was nothing here in Petra&rsquo;s own place,
her room, to speak her real! Stranger yet that there was
nothing, not a book, not a flower,&mdash;not a scrap of living
interest anywhere! It might have been a stage bedroom.
All the properties necessary for the idea that
somebody did use it to sleep in&mdash;yes. But you must wait
for the actress to come on, to know what she was like.
<i>A stage bedroom!</i> And yet this was Petra&rsquo;s retreat, her
<span class="pb" id="Page_260">260</span>
very own room, her place. Lewis almost shuddered at it.
The Maid of the Alder&mdash;the hollow woman. It might
have been her cave! It was so soulless.</p>
<p>The brilliant October sunlight turned the shut curtains
into a glaring purplish pink. The image of a peacock
spreading a mammoth spectroscopic tail was embossed
on the oyster-colored rug. There were smaller
peacocks on the backs of the chairs. Suddenly Lewis
stopped looking for signs of Petra. When she came in
here, herself, her personality, was shut away, outside the
four walls of her bedroom. He felt that it must beat
around the walls all night to get in. She slept in a place
shut away from herself. This was madness! She wasn&rsquo;t
here. Hadn&rsquo;t been here ever. Not really. Where <i>was</i>
she?</p>
<p>Elise had followed him in. He turned to her and all
she saw was an efficient, cool person who would make
everything all right. She was beginning to get over her
scare. Doctor Pryne was not scared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Miss Farwell any other room than this? A
sitting room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. There is the bath. I looked in there when I
came up. She didn&rsquo;t use her towels last night. I don&rsquo;t
think she came into the room at all after I fixed it, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Farwell wore a white dress last night. Whitish,
anyway. See if that is in her closet, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elise hurried to the closet. In spite of the way Doctor
Pryne&rsquo;s demands came&mdash;like firecrackers crackling&mdash;Elise
still trusted to his coolness. It kept her cool.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. That dress isn&rsquo;t here. It was a new one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Miss Farwell ever sleep anywhere else than
here, when she&rsquo;s at home? At the guest house, for instance?
Or in another bedroom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. We don&rsquo;t keep the beds made up, except
when there are guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any ideas at all where Miss Farwell <i>might</i>
have gone last night? To sleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. I thought she came to bed early, sir. I stayed
up last night to close up the house. Mrs. Farwell told
me then that Miss Farwell had gone to bed early and
that we were to be quiet. I mean, sir, we stood just outside
Miss Farwell&rsquo;s door, talking in whispers, not to
wake Miss Farwell, when Mrs. Farwell said good night
to me. Mrs. Farwell thought just as I did that Miss
Farwell was here in bed, asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you be able to tell if any of Miss Farwell&rsquo;s
clothes were gone? A coat, for instance. It was cold last
night. She was dressed in a low-necked, sleeveless dance
frock. She couldn&rsquo;t go away anywhere like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, sir, she couldn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll see, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis went to the windows, one after another, and
yanking the cords that worked the curtains, let in the
light. From each cord dangled a heavy silk peacock for
tassel. Ugh!</p>
<p>The maid turned from the open sliding doors of
the wardrobe which took up one whole side of the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything is here, sir. She hasn&rsquo;t so many clothes!
<span class="pb" id="Page_262">262</span>
Lovely dresses, but not many. I&rsquo;d know if anything was
gone, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time did you lock the house up last night? If
Miss Farwell had gone out for a walk, say, and came
back after you locked it, could she have got in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was after you had all gone, I locked it. After the
party. Around midnight. Miss Farwell hasn&rsquo;t a key.
There aren&rsquo;t any. One of the servants bolts the doors
and windows the last thing at night and that is the only
time they are locked. If Miss Farwell had come to the
door and found it locked, though, she had only to ring
the bell. Somebody would have heard. Or she could have
knocked on her father&rsquo;s window. He has a bedroom right
on the terrace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Doctor Pryne&rsquo;s coolness was still consoling
her somewhat, Elise&rsquo;s face, during these rapid questions
and answers, had gone gradually dead white and her
knees were shaking. She presumed at this point to ask
a question on her own part: &ldquo;Oh, sir, do you think anything
has happened? There&rsquo;s the river beyond the
meadows....&rdquo;</p>
<p>If looks could kill, the look Elise got from Doctor
Lewis Pryne in return for her own one question would
have struck her down on the spot.&mdash;So she said later,
when she told the whole story of what she called the
&ldquo;inquest&rdquo; to Clare,&mdash;told it with tears and to the accompaniment
of many careful promptings. She knew
from that look that her idea of Miss Farwell as a possible
suicide angered the doctor even more than it frightened
<span class="pb" id="Page_263">263</span>
herself. So she said hastily, shaking more than ever, but
the color a little returning to her blanched cheeks, &ldquo;Or
it might be she&rsquo;s kidnaped. Mrs. Farwell is one of the
richest women in the State of Massachusetts. It said so
in the <i>Transcript</i>. They might know she would give anything
to get Miss Farwell back. Do you think it&rsquo;s a kidnaping,
sir? Oh, poor Mrs. Farwell! This will break
her heart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was weeping openly by then. But she hoped it
would be she and no other who told Mrs. Farwell the
news. And certainly nobody could get ahead of her in
telling it to the other stage-hands at Green Doors. It
would be strange if anybody got ahead of her, since she
was the very first to learn of the disappearance and the
inquest had begun with her, so to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say Mr. Farwell sleeps downstairs? Take me
to his room. Hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the doctor had her by an elbow, pushing her
ahead of him. Again they were on the stairs, only this
time he was propelling her downward. But in spite of the
steady pressure of the doctor&rsquo;s fingers on her elbow, and
his air of a perfect right to command, she found the
courage to suggest, &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better tell Mrs. Farwell,
sir? Mr. Farwell won&rsquo;t like being disturbed at this hour.
Mrs. Farwell won&rsquo;t mind. She&rsquo;s a lovely woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the doctor said to that was, &ldquo;Mr. Farwell&rsquo;s room.
Which way?&rdquo; They were at the foot of the stairs.</p>
<p>But Elise never told Lewis which way, for he had
dropped her arm. No, more than that, he actually pushed
<span class="pb" id="Page_264">264</span>
her away. Petra was coming toward them through the
great hall from the street door. She had left it wide
open behind her. The door was a wide, high plaque of
golden light; and Petra against it, in her glassy frock,
was more like a ghost than a girl&mdash;just that first minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it? What is the matter, Elise? Why, good
morning, Doctor Pryne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, it was Petra, not ghostly now. Lewis&rsquo; eyes had
adjusted themselves to the morning sunlight flooding
the door. It was Petra all right. Reticent. Nice-mannered.
Pleasant.</p>
<p>Lewis whirled on the staring maid. &ldquo;Thanks for all
you did,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Go away now.&rdquo; Elise went, but no
farther than the dining room; from there she heard most
of what passed between the doctor and Miss Farwell
and reported it concisely, in spite of excited weeping, to
Mrs. Farwell herself a few minutes later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t sleep in your room last night, Petra. I
was frightened. I am afraid I frightened the maid. Are
you all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I could see something was the matter with Elise.
I am sorry either of you was worried. I meant to get in
before anybody noticed. I&rsquo;m all right, thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There she stood, quite close to him,&mdash;real. In her
party frock and her fragile high-heeled slippers, immaculate
and self-possessed. Even her hair was as shining and
groomed as last night, but with a new touch added: a
narrow violet band was tied around her head, back of
her ears, holding the curls in place. It was that ribbon
<span class="pb" id="Page_265">265</span>
with its flat little bow at the side of her head, which
infuriated Lewis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you sleep last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elise, listening from the dining-room, where after all
it was her place to be ready to serve Miss Farwell her
breakfast when she came in for it, was amazed at the
harshness of the tone putting the question. Doctor Pryne
had been sharp and quick with herself&mdash;but not harsh
like this. This was downright rude&mdash;and to Miss Farwell!
But Miss Farwell was equal to him. She was equal
to any one. She was every bit as real a lady as was Mrs.
Farwell herself, in spite of being so different. Elise knew.
She had lived in the house with Miss Farwell for three
years now.</p>
<p>Petra said, &ldquo;Somehow I don&rsquo;t think that you have a
right to ask, Doctor Pryne. Not like that exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have. I have been in hell. Scared out of my wits.
I thought you&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t know what had happened to
you. You&rsquo;ve got to tell me where you were, Petra,&mdash;where
you slept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Lewis saw that although Petra was very erect in
the flooding sunlight, with brushed hair, and coolly half-smiling
lips, her face was haggard beyond belief. Austerely
haggard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Petra&mdash;!&rdquo; he urged again&mdash;almost gently now&mdash;then
stopped. &ldquo;My dear, have you had breakfast?&rdquo; But
she had brushed her hair, tied a ribbon about it in an
infinitely enchanting way,&mdash;so why not breakfast too?
Why did he worry about so trivial a matter in any case!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">266</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. We&mdash;I had breakfast. Hours ago.&rdquo; But she
looked down, away from Lewis&rsquo; look, very quickly as
she changed the &ldquo;we&rdquo; to &ldquo;I.&rdquo; Now that she was looking
down, Lewis could see how, over night, her face had
thinned. He could almost see the bones of her cheek
through the transparent flesh.</p>
<p>She looked up as if to ward off his discernment.
&ldquo;Doctor Pryne! Could you get along at the office without
me to-day? I am&mdash;I think I am&mdash;well, perhaps
too tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Petra! I can&rsquo;t go off and leave you. You must
come with me. Now. You needn&rsquo;t work. But I&rsquo;m not
going to leave you to Clare. We can talk in the car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Petra misunderstood the reason for his insistence.
She had suddenly remembered that Janet wouldn&rsquo;t be
in the office. The night she had passed had blurred her
memory of ordinary things. But now she took hold of
ordinary things again, even steadied herself by their
cognizance. She was young, strong, and no shirker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course, I must come. I had forgotten Janet
wasn&rsquo;t coming. Truly I had. Will you wait while I
change? I saw your car outside. We&rsquo;ll still be in time.
It is still early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis went out to wait in the car. He would not think.
There was not one single thing that ordinary conjecture
could do for him. Petra must confide in him before he
would ever be able to think one straight thought again.
In an amazingly short time she came running out, pulling
on a polo coat over one of her office dresses. She
<span class="pb" id="Page_267">267</span>
waited till she was in the car beside him to put on her
felt hat. Petra&rsquo;s hats and coats, Lewis had noticed gradually,
as the summer wore on, had nothing of the magic
and unique loveliness of her frocks. They were merely
concealing and casual. In fact, this same violet-colored
felt, with its moderately wide and down-tilting brim,
had sufficed her all summer in town, and this polo coat
was the only coat he had ever seen her wear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry that I had to keep you waiting.&rdquo; She said
it in her ordinary ingenuous and clear, clipped tones as
he started his engine.</p>
<p>That she was not wavering in her good manners, that
not so much as her voice was nicked by the night&rsquo;s experience
(whatever it had been!), brought all Lewis&rsquo;
anger sweeping back. What was she made of! She might
play this game with Clare, years on end, if she liked,&mdash;this
game of good manners covering a secret, vital, beating
heart. But she could not play it with Lewis himself
any longer. They were to understand each other now.
He felt capable of wrenching Petra&rsquo;s secret from her heart
with the strength of his bare hands. Her reticence&mdash;it
should go down. He would destroy it. Never in his
life had he been more exasperated.</p>
<p>Then they came to the one sharp turn in Clare&rsquo;s beloved
little country road, and Lewis&rsquo; violent feelings
almost ended in a violent smash; for a stalled roadster
was there, taking up the middle of the way. Only by
a superhuman pulling of his whole steering gear to one
side, then steadying the bounding car among threatening
<span class="pb" id="Page_268">268</span>
tree boles and so somehow getting it back to the
road, did Lewis avoid calamity. Back, safe in the road,
Lewis pressed his accelerator and sped on without a
backward glance or even a curse at the driver of the
stalled car. Lewis had seen the man well enough in
that split second when he jammed on the brakes and
turned the wheel. It was Neil McCloud, on his knees,
struggling to get a tire either on or off one of the
wheels of his gaudy roadster. Neil McCloud, on the
almost unused road to Green Doors, not fifteen minutes
after Petra had appeared from her mysterious night
away from home! If the tire had not punctured, Neil
could have been a quarter of the way back to Boston
by this time. And he would have been. Certainly he had
not meant Lewis and Petra to pass him.</p>
<p>Lewis shut his lips and waited for Petra to speak.
If she would only exclaim, &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that Neil?&rdquo; Or
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you stop? That man needed help!&rdquo; Or
she might say, &ldquo;Whatever is Neil McCloud doing out
here so early!&rdquo; Yes, Petra might say practically any
inane thing at this minute, and Lewis, God help him,
would have believed it ingenuous. It was her saying
nothing that was so blasting....</p>
<p>They had rushed on for almost a full minute&rsquo;s
damning silence before Lewis gave up his desperate
hope that Petra would say some innocent word and
looked at her. Her face under the rakish, slouched felt
hat was utterly colorless, but her eyes were <i>swimmingly
bright</i>. Lewis could see that. And even as he looked,
<span class="pb" id="Page_269">269</span>
although she did not turn her face or give the slightest
voluntary sign that she was conscious of his regard, her
pallor vanished. Fire kindled on her cheeks.</p>
<p>Now Lewis knew why he had been so bitterly angry
all these minutes since Petra&rsquo;s safe return, with her
hair brushed to glisteningness, and a violet ribbon binding
her curls. Intuition had outleapt conjecture. Even
before Petra had spoken a word, while she had stood,
an angel, against the bright gold plaque of the October
sunlight filling the doorway, Lewis had known that he
hated her beyond reason, that he loved her beyond
reason&mdash;more than he had ever loved her before,&mdash;and
that she was not his.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">270</div>
<h2 id="c22"><i>Chapter Twenty-Two</i></h2><div class="img"><img src="images/ch.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="30" /></div>
<p>Lewis gathered the morning&rsquo;s mail out of the
box let into the office door, and passing through the
reception room, shut himself into his own office. He had
let Petra out at the street entrance and then driven on
to find a parking place for his car. She had come up
ahead of him and would be in the dressing room now.
He put the mail down on his desk and settled himself
into his chair.</p>
<p>This was Tuesday, the morning Lewis gave to the
clinic. But he must sort his mail first. He could not hear
Petra come out of the dressing room and move around
in the reception-office, but he was as conscious of all her
motions out there beyond his shut door as if she were
making them in his heart. He saw her looking down,
glancing up, picking up the telephone. She must stop
moving about in his consciousness....</p>
<p>He was here, alone, with the day&rsquo;s work before him.
Why, he needn&rsquo;t even think about Petra if he didn&rsquo;t
want to, still less let her move about, looking up, looking
<span class="pb" id="Page_271">271</span>
down, picking up the telephone, through the very
tissues of his heart.</p>
<p>But what was it Petra had said to McCloud that day
of the miracle? Lewis knew it by heart, it was often in
his mind; yet now he was groping for it confusedly!
He put his head into his hands. Was this it?&mdash;&ldquo;Love
is the word. You must say that. Try to say &lsquo;I love.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And McCloud had said it&mdash;while the shackles of
hate and rebellion fell away and left him a free man&mdash;free
in love. If Lewis&rsquo; shackles could only fall, as had
Neil&rsquo;s! If he could only love Petra and not hate her,
then he would be able to bear, perhaps, not having her.
And hatred of Petra seemed to make him hate everything
else. What was even his work to him now! He
was bored by the sight of this pile of letters. He was
unnerved, paralyzed. But love does not unnerve and
paralyze. It isn&rsquo;t in its nature. Hate does that. Yes, if
only he could say, as Neil had said, &ldquo;I love!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But how could he say it? How could an ordinary person
like himself love as the saints love? Well, Neil
was no saint and he had said it. But the Little Flower
herself had helped Neil. She wasn&rsquo;t helping Lewis.
And why should she? Lord have mercy on him, a
sinner!</p>
<p>Lewis lifted his head from his hands. He must get
to work, anyway. That meant he must begin to use his
mind&mdash;stop writhing! That was all his mind had done
ever since he had seen that hot blush spread over Petra&rsquo;s
face. He and Petra had scarcely spoken to each other on
<span class="pb" id="Page_272">272</span>
the twenty-mile drive which had been made in less
time than Lewis cared to remember now. What had he
thought speed would do for the situation? But here
was this bunch of mail. He&rsquo;d got to concentrate. This
was his life, his job, here under his hand. His plain
duty.</p>
<p>Lewis tore open an envelope. Inside was a scrawl
from Nelson, the brain surgeon, giving the hour set
for a certain Eric Larsen&rsquo;s operation. Nine-thirty, this
morning. The chances of the man&rsquo;s recovering were
slim, Lewis knew, but there was no choice; an operation
there must be. Lewis&rsquo; responsibility had ended, once he
had passed the man on to Nelson, of course. But he
had promised Eric Larsen to go with him to the operating
room and stand by until the affair was over. Lewis
had been at the hospital yesterday just before driving
out to Meadowbrook; had spent the better part of an
hour beside Larsen&rsquo;s bed in the midst of the ward. That
Larsen did not once rouse to the point of recognizing
him had not made Lewis feel the time wasted. Who
was he to say that the man&rsquo;s consciousness&mdash;at some
incommunicable level&mdash;was not aware of his friend at
hand, sympathetic and hopeful for him. And when
Larsen came out of ether this morning, if he did come
out, it would be no strange, chance nurse whom his
glance should meet, but the one person who knew all
about his failures, his crimes,&mdash;and his hopes of regeneration:
the only friend he laid claim to, Lewis himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">273</div>
<p>But nine-thirty! That meant that Lewis must get
along. The rest of this mail must be handed over to&mdash;Petra.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me love again! Give me the love to love You
with. Not for my sake. For Eric Larsen&rsquo;s sake. He
needs me now, this minute, worthless as I am. Give me
this love so that I may go on and do this one morning&rsquo;s
work that You have given me. Make your gifts whole&mdash;the
work and the love to do it with.&mdash;For this suffering
Eric Larsen&rsquo;s sake, not mine, who am unworthy,
Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis was looking around for his hat, as he prayed.
There it was, knocked onto the floor somehow. The
office certainly needed Miss Frazier. He collected the
hat and snatched up the remaining bunch of letters.
And as he performed these simple, objective acts, the
shackles fell. There was no vision, no sensible response
from on High. Nothing like that. Nothing in the world&mdash;but
hatred and anger dissolving from his consciousness
with the rapidity of light. &ldquo;Deo Gratias&rdquo; was all
Lewis breathed in recognition of the Spirit&rsquo;s blowing,
and in another instant he was out in the reception office,
by Petra&rsquo;s desk.</p>
<p>Petra was talking to McCloud over the telephone.
Lewis recognized the vibrations of McCloud&rsquo;s voice,
although he caught nothing of the words. Petra, glancing
up at her employer, said quickly, interrupting the
voice, &ldquo;The doctor&rsquo;s here, Neil. Waiting to speak to
me. Call me up when I get back from lunching with
<span class="pb" id="Page_274">274</span>
Dick. Two this afternoon. Good-by,&rdquo; and put the instrument
down sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a tearing hurry, Petra,&rdquo; Lewis said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
have to go over these letters. Clip all that look personal
together. Whether they&rsquo;re marked personal or not.
Make notes about the rest on the envelopes. If anything
urgent comes up, I&rsquo;ll be at the hospital till noon,
anyway, but don&rsquo;t call me for anything there till after
eleven. No matter how urgent. I&rsquo;m watching an operation.
I&rsquo;ll be back here by two, and if it&rsquo;s possible, I&rsquo;ll
let you go home then. There&rsquo;s aspirin in the right top
drawer of my desk. Better take two. If that Philadelphia
man shows up or calls, tell him I&rsquo;ll see him at
three, with the boy, here. But aside from that, keep the
afternoon clear. I don&rsquo;t like your looking so tired.
Think you can stick it until two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! I&rsquo;m perfectly all right. The aspirin will
help a lot. Everything will be all right here. Is it Eric
Larsen&mdash;the operation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petra had a special interest in Eric Larsen, the big
shambling Swede, with his shifty eyes and oddly contrasting
child-like trust in the goodness and power of
Doctor Pryne. But she had been almost afraid of him
when he first started coming. She had hidden her nervousness,
however, and even Janet had not guessed what
an ordeal those first few visits had been. Soon fear had
turned to pity. Then had come the afternoon when Eric
Larsen had appeared before her desk, roaring drunk
and dangerously ugly, just after Doctor Pryne had
<span class="pb" id="Page_275">275</span>
gone for the day. Petra, though in a very agony of
terror, had stood by Janet when she insisted they must
get him quietly back to his lodging house and up to his
bedroom safe. Janet said that otherwise he would spend
the night in jail and that wouldn&rsquo;t help what Doctor
Pryne was doing for him,&mdash;now would it! The next
day Doctor Pryne had been appalled by their temerity,
or tried to seem so; but the truth was, and they both
knew it, that he was, in his heart, delighted.&mdash;So now,
naturally, Petra had a special interest, if this was the
day they were operating on Eric Larsen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s Larsen,&rdquo; Lewis replied. &ldquo;Nine-thirty. If
he pulls through, we&rsquo;ll write all about him to his
mother in Upsala. She may send for him to come home.
Almost any mother would now, in spite of everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petra tingled with gratification. Why, this was the
way Doctor Pryne talked with Janet herself, confiding
plans and hopes to her concerning his cases! To cover
up her sudden delight she said again, &ldquo;Everything will
be all right here. Don&rsquo;t give anything a thought, Doctor
Pryne.&rdquo;&mdash;How ready she was to forget his unreasonableness
of the early morning, now that he was treating
her not only with the respect he gave Janet, but
almost with the same intimacy of confidence! Perhaps
he hadn&rsquo;t been really angry with her, after all, nor intended
to humiliate and wound her. Perhaps it was
only because she had been so terribly tired Petra had
felt, suddenly, in the hall at Green Doors early this
morning, that Doctor Pryne disliked and mistrusted
<span class="pb" id="Page_276">276</span>
her. It must have been just her stupid mistake. Even
without his being so sweet now, she would have come
to realize her stupid mistake, given a little time. For
Doctor Pryne would never use the tone she thought he
had used to her, even if he had wanted to; he was too
innately kind. And his silence all the long drive in had
had nothing to do with her, as she in her mean selfish
egoism had thought it had! He had been worrying
about Eric Larsen. About the operation. Naturally, he
wouldn&rsquo;t want to talk!&mdash;Now, if only Petra weren&rsquo;t
just a little frightened about Teresa, she would be
happy indeed! For Doctor Pryne had said, &ldquo;If he pulls
through, we&rsquo;ll write all about him to his mother in
Upsala. She may send for him to come home. Almost
any mother would now, in spite of everything.&rdquo; <i>We
will write. We.</i> Not <i>I</i>! She might have been Janet!</p>
<p>The happiness of feeling herself not only reinstated
but lifted even higher than ordinary in Doctor Pryne&rsquo;s
good will did more for Petra than the two aspirin
tablets which she immediately and obediently gulped
down. She was hardly tired at all now, in spite of having
had no sleep.</p>
<p class="tb">Lewis got back to the office before Petra had returned
from lunching with Dick. He supposed that date must
have been made before last night. He left his door
open so that he would hear when Petra came in.</p>
<p>He heard her step at last and called out to her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
back, Petra. Please come in here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">277</div>
<p>He was surprised that she neither answered nor came,
for a long minute. But he felt her there, all that tense,
hesitant minute, just beyond the line of his vision. He
knew, by some sixth sense, that she was struggling
mightily with herself to obey his command. Then she
came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is it? What has happened?&rdquo; Lewis was up
and around the desk the instant he saw her face. &ldquo;Petra!
You frighten me, looking like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I don&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;re like some kind of god,
above everything. Above being frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better tell me what&rsquo;s happened, though.
You&rsquo;ve no reason to be angry with me, anyway. What
have I done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not angry with you. You haven&rsquo;t done anything.
How is Larsen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Larsen&rsquo;s dead. But don&rsquo;t cry. Everything was done
that could be. He just had to die, I guess. <i>Don&rsquo;t cry.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not crying. Or am I? I thought I wasn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; She
was wiping the tears from her face with the back of her
wrist. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never write that letter to his mother in
Upsala now, will we!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be better so. I&rsquo;m afraid she was never much
of a mother, you know. What has happened between
you and Dick, Petra? Anything you want to tell me?
I can see you have had some sort of a shock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have. It&rsquo;s my letter. The one I wrote him. You
read it, he said. That simply idiotic letter. I wrote it
because I was sorry for Dick. I thought I&rsquo;d been all
<span class="pb" id="Page_278">278</span>
wrong about him and Clare. I thought I&rsquo;d been cruel
to him! I thought I&rsquo;d insulted him, unforgivably. So I
told him why I couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t marry him. And
you read it. And I won&rsquo;t work here any more. I
couldn&rsquo;t, now. But where can I work? How can I earn
money? I want never to see you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure I know what you&rsquo;re talking about,
Petra. Why you don&rsquo;t want to work for me, I mean, or
see me again. But that&rsquo;s all right. No reason I should
know. There are other jobs. We&rsquo;ll find you one. Is that
all that makes you&mdash;that makes you look like this? I
thought something terrible had happened. I really
did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something has. Worse than his showing you that
letter and your knowing everything about me!&rdquo; She
stopped, took off her hat, dropped it into the patients&rsquo;
chair. That incongruously worn-looking, slouchy felt hat!
Her hands went to her hair, pressing it back from her
forehead. Then, standing very straight, and with eyes
on the window, not Lewis, she said, &ldquo;Dick says that
things are wearing &lsquo;pretty thin&rsquo; between my father and
Clare. He says that he and Clare belong to each other
&lsquo;by right of understanding and sympathy.&rsquo; He says he
worships her and that&mdash;that she kissed him. On the
road. Last night. When they went out. You remember?
He says Clare wants me to know. He says Clare thinks
that they owe it to me, to <i>let</i> me know. He says Clare is so
fond of me that for a long time&mdash;for months&mdash;she
has tried to think that black was white, and white black,
<span class="pb" id="Page_279">279</span>
so that she might not lose me as her daughter. He says
Clare feels more a traitor to me than to my father. He
says Clare feels that I need her more than my father
needs her. He says Clare will never, never stop loving
me and taking care of me, as long as I will let her. He
says he means both financially and spiritually. He says
it would simply break Clare&rsquo;s heart if I change in my
feelings toward her simply because she has changed in
her feelings toward my father. He says Clare trusts
me to be objective and detached in this difficult situation.
More difficult for Clare than for any of us, but
she is being big and brave. He says Clare wants him,
Dick, to help me to a sane, large-minded, unselfish
point of view.... But before he said anything at all,
he swore me to secrecy about what he was going to say.
They are going to wait to tell Father, you see, until he
has finished the last chapter of the novel. It might upset
him, hurt the book. Clare thought even of that. But
there&rsquo;s even a better reason for secrecy. Clare hasn&rsquo;t
actually decided she will marry Dick. Dick says he has
still to get her definite promise. Dick says she is terrified
that she can&rsquo;t make him absolutely happy. But she
can. He will make her see she can. So he swore me to
secrecy and then told me all this. And my first conscious
act, since, is to tell you every word he said,&mdash;the whole
business. That&rsquo;s the kind of a girl I am. You see the
kind of girl I am. You see. You see. You see. The kind
of girl I am. You see! You see! You&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Lewis by now had stopped her. He had laid
<span class="pb" id="Page_280">280</span>
firm hands on her and put her into his own chair, even
in that moment remembering that the patients&rsquo; chair
was occupied by a violet felt hat,&mdash;shabby, yes, but
since it seemed to be Petra&rsquo;s only hat, probably worth
preserving....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit there, Petra. Stop. There&rsquo;s nothing to cry about.
Be as mad as you like. But don&rsquo;t cry. Dick must have
gone crazy. This is beyond reason. Of course, a woman
like Clare will never give up a Lowell Farwell for that
callow fool. She never expected him to believe she
would. She was merely practicing her art&mdash;out on the
moonlit road last night. Dick happened to be there to
practice on, that was all. The poor boy&rsquo;s stark crazy.
And Clare was rather mad herself, last night. She was
horribly wounded in the most vulnerable part of her
spirit&rsquo;s anatomy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Petra was going on again. Her head was in her
hands, as his had been in his hands earlier in the day.
And she was talking now not to him, but to herself, behind
her hands. &ldquo;They are horrible. All of them. Clare,
Father, Dick, Marian. All the people who belong to me.
All I belong to. I have known it a long time. But I was
weak. I didn&rsquo;t know how to escape. How to get out.
Now I shall escape. Now I shall get out. Only how can
I earn the money? I won&rsquo;t work here. Not for you. But
I must get away from Green Doors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis heard Petra, faintly, going on with it while
he was off getting her a glass of water. He came back,
<span class="pb" id="Page_281">281</span>
said, &ldquo;Drink this. Stop talking. Let me think a minute.
We&rsquo;re both too excited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped talking, but she did not take the water.
And she kept her head in her hands. Lewis sat himself
on the corner of the desk. He took his cigarette case
from his pocket but put it back unopened.</p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;Petra, I understand. Everything, almost,
I think. Yes, you must get away from Green Doors.
Live your own life. I thought that, you know, that first
day, when I went there to tea. And last night it was
even more clear to me. But there&rsquo;s nothing to be so
frightened about. You are silly to be scared about the
money. You&rsquo;ll make enough. And if you don&rsquo;t want to
go on with this job, well, there&rsquo;s no need to. At least,
not after Miss Frazier gets back. You must stand by
till then, of course. You wouldn&rsquo;t like yourself if you
didn&rsquo;t. But after she&rsquo;s back, you can go. I&rsquo;d already
been thinking about it. There are other jobs, you know.
And what about Teresa? Can&rsquo;t you live with her? The
way you planned&mdash;once before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petra had listened, hardly breathing. Now she lifted
her ravaged young face and looked at him, hope dawning.
&ldquo;But do you mean it? Am I good enough to recommend?
Any one would believe you, of course, if you
said I was. But can you really say it? You have to go
slow when you dictate to me, you know. And yesterday
in that letter I spelt hypophrenia wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>used</i> it wrong, you mean,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It was a silly
<span class="pb" id="Page_282">282</span>
word to use. I intended feeble-mindedness and should
have said it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are laughing. You are making fun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all. But I&rsquo;m not crying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will recommend me? In spite of the spelling
and all? But&mdash;but eighteen dollars a week won&rsquo;t
be enough. If I don&rsquo;t live at Green Doors, if I go right
away, I must have more than that. I&rsquo;m not worth it,
I know, but I <i>must</i> have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with you there. You could manage well
enough. But we needn&rsquo;t go into that now. There&rsquo;s loads
of time. We&rsquo;ll work the whole thing out together. You
and I. When you are quiet and rested. Once we face
the whole situation squarely and intelligently, the next
steps will come clear. But you must go home now and
rest. That&rsquo;s what I called you in for, to tell you I
wouldn&rsquo;t need you this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Neil called up? I&rsquo;d better wait for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The telephone hasn&rsquo;t rung since I came in.&rdquo; Lewis
took out his cigarette case again and this time lit a
cigarette. &ldquo;Drink that water, Petra,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
know, I thought you were going to have hysterics here
a minute ago. Congratulations that you didn&rsquo;t. You had
cause enough. But now I want to tell you something.
About Neil&mdash;. He can&rsquo;t help you disentangle yourself
from this Green Doors spider web. Or if he does, it
will only be for you and him another web that you&rsquo;ll
start spinning together with the same disastrous cruelty
to lives. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you two are to each
<span class="pb" id="Page_283">283</span>
other. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what has happened between
you. If you want <i>really</i> to be free of Green Doors&mdash;of
what Green Doors stands for in your life&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
got to do it alone. Neil can&rsquo;t help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petra had dropped her head into her hands again,
when he assured her that the telephone had not rung
since he came in; but he thought she was listening. He
went on, anyway, speaking gently and with a kind of
brittle clearness. &ldquo;Neil is married, Petra. Married. Just
as long as Edyth Dayton lives, he is married. No matter
how devotedly he loves another woman, Edyth will remain,
in his deepest consciousness, his wife.... Didn&rsquo;t
you know that, Petra?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis had never been farther from thinking of his
own interests. For the moment he, Lewis Pryne, existed
only to save this girl from calamity. He knew now that
his yesterday&rsquo;s intention of asking Petra to be his wife,
no matter if she did love Neil, had been mad and wrong.
A heart like Petra&rsquo;s&mdash;so passionate and whole&mdash;must
break or be reborn; it could never be patched up and
used again, like a broken vase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know that, Petra,&rdquo; he repeated, when the
silence grew too painful. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know that Neil
will consider himself married, no matter how good a
divorce his wife brings home from Switzerland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This she did hear and looked up at Lewis. She seemed,
strangely, almost herself, he thought,&mdash;almost natural
now and calm. And she bore it out by saying in her
normal, ingenuous, even winged voice, &ldquo;You are talking
<span class="pb" id="Page_284">284</span>
about Neil? But I do know that about him, Doctor
Pryne. Of course Neil won&rsquo;t marry as long as Edyth
lives. He can&rsquo;t. I understand perfectly. It breaks my
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was rather ironic, perhaps, that those four definite,
simple, unenigmatic words spoken in that winged voice
were what now finished the business of Lewis&rsquo; own
heart&rsquo;s breaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I know it does. But Petra,
that isn&rsquo;t the point. The point is not to break Neil&rsquo;s
heart, and little children&rsquo;s hearts and&mdash;and Teresa&rsquo;s.
You must tell everything to Teresa, I think. She, of all
people, can help you.... But now you must get home
and rest. We&rsquo;ll go in my car. No, I forgot. We can&rsquo;t.
There&rsquo;s that appointment at three you made with the
Philadelphia people. You must go in a taxi then. But
look here, Petra. What about Clare? The maid&mdash;Elise?&mdash;will
have told her all about your coming in this
morning. That you didn&rsquo;t sleep at Green Doors! You&rsquo;d
better, after all, wait till I&rsquo;m free. That&rsquo;s something
we&rsquo;ll have to fix up. And these people are due now,
almost. My dear, I hadn&rsquo;t realized what a mess I may
have made for you this morning until this minute. Had
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petra was looking at him with the strangest, faint
smile. Her eyes had come blue. They must have been
not blue but dark with pain and fear all this time, or
now they would not be coming blue like this as he looked
into them! There was a little color in her face too.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">285</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sweet to care about such little things&mdash;concerning
me!&rdquo; she was saying. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d rather go right
along on the train now. I&rsquo;ll just make it. I haven&rsquo;t a
dollar to spend on a taxi. Clare has already questioned
me. She called up the first thing we got in this morning.
But it&rsquo;s all right. I told her I slept in the guest house
under one of the steamer blankets. I said my room
seemed airless and my head ached. She and Father have
gone to the Cape, anyway, for over night. That&rsquo;s why
she called up instead of waiting till I came home. She
won&rsquo;t be there, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petra put her own construction on the strange gravity
that grew in Doctor Pryne&rsquo;s eyes as she made these
explanations, and added quickly, &ldquo;Yes, I know. A lie.
But I have had to lie to Clare. She lies to me with
action. If I was to live with her at all, I had to protect
myself, hadn&rsquo;t I! But now it will end. After I am away
from her, I hope I shall never tell another lie as long
as I live. I am going to try terribly hard. It is Neil
who has made me ashamed of my lies. Teresa never
knew about them, of course. That&rsquo;s why Neil stopped
coming to Green Doors with me. He wouldn&rsquo;t lie, and
simply hated having me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis was suddenly aware of sounds out in the reception
room. Somebody coughed&mdash;to get his attention,
he imagined. It would be the Philadelphia people, with
their son. He said in a low voice to Petra, and hurriedly,
&ldquo;Go wash your face now, while I call the taxi.
We&rsquo;ll charge the mileage to office expenses, so don&rsquo;t
<span class="pb" id="Page_286">286</span>
fuss.&rdquo; And when Petra&mdash;her face innocent of tear
stains and well powdered&mdash;returned from the dressing
room through Miss Frazier&rsquo;s door, Lewis was tipping
two small white pills from the palm of his hand into an
envelope. He put the envelope, carefully sealed, into
the pocket of Petra&rsquo;s polo coat, and said, &ldquo;Take two
when you get to Green Doors. They&rsquo;re a sedative. Then
go to bed. Really to bed. Make them give you dinner
on a tray. It won&rsquo;t matter, since Clare and your father
are away.&mdash;<i>Would</i> they have gone to the Cape, do you
think, on this jaunt, if Dick had things straight? Of
course they wouldn&rsquo;t. Put that out of your head.&mdash;By
eight or so you&rsquo;ll be rested. Then we can talk. Get dressed
and I&rsquo;ll be out as near nine as I can manage. Perhaps
we can go over to the guest-house piazza? Like the first
time, remember? We&rsquo;ll talk out the whole thing,&mdash;about
Neil, I mean now. And after all, you mustn&rsquo;t tell
Teresa. You&rsquo;d better tell me. It will be easier&mdash;and
save Teresa from being hurt. <i>We&rsquo;ll protect Teresa.</i> You
want to, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, because the bewildered look she gave him
stabbed him almost beyond endurance, he whispered&mdash;for
the door all this while was open into the reception
room&mdash;&ldquo;My dearest, everything will be all right. In
the end. Why, the whole world is waiting spread out
for you, lovely long years of your life. Things pass. Even
loneliness passes. Truly. I have&mdash;been lonely&mdash;and I
know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">287</div>
<p>Down at the curb the taxi driver opened the taxi
door when he saw them emerge from the foyer of the
office building. But Lewis stopped short, midway across
the pavement. There was something more he must say,
even if those people were waiting for him up there in
his office, the pale mother holding the writhing idiot
boy desperately in tired arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Petra,&rdquo; Lewis exclaimed, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re in this together, you
and I. You can trust my devotion as you&rsquo;d trust a
brother&rsquo;s. If you had a brother, I mean, who loved you
very deeply! I&rsquo;m going to help you get clear of the
spider web of Green Doors&mdash;and you can talk to me
about Neil all you want. You can tell me anything. You
see, my dear, I&rsquo;m fond of Neil too. There&rsquo;s nothing I
won&rsquo;t understand when you tell it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petra took Lewis&rsquo; hand, lifted it, and pressed her
mouth on its back. A warm, quick kiss. There in the
middle of the sidewalk on Marlborough Street in the
midst of the foot traffic! Then she ran, before Lewis
could follow her, and stumbled blindly into the taxi.
The driver stayed waiting a second to see whether Doctor
Pryne was coming with the young lady all the way
to Meadowbrook, decided he wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;Lewis gave him
no sign one way or the other&mdash;and shut the door. As
the cab drove off, Petra kept her face turned away so
that Lewis could not see it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">288</div>
<h2 id="c23"><i>Chapter Twenty-Three</i></h2><div class="img"><img src="images/ch.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="30" /></div>
<p>As Lewis re&euml;ntered the reception office, Petra&rsquo;s
telephone was ringing. It was Neil, calling Petra as he
had promised, but one hour late. He was surprised that
it was Lewis who answered, but said hastily, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m grateful
it is you, Doctor. I&rsquo;m calling from Meadowbrook. Is
there any chance, if I drive right in now, you could see
me? It&rsquo;s something pretty important, Doctor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About yourself?&mdash;Or Petra?&rdquo; If McCloud had been
there in the room, instead of merely on the wire, he
would have been shocked by the expression on the face
of the man of whom he was so confidently asking a favor.
The accustomed light was quite gone from Lewis&rsquo; features.
He was gray and stern and looked ten years older.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It concerns us both. Equally, I guess,&rdquo; was Neil&rsquo;s reply
after an instant&rsquo;s hesitation. &ldquo;But I wouldn&rsquo;t ask for
your time like this if it weren&rsquo;t pretty important, Doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you start now, I&rsquo;ll be free about the time
you get here. But make it snappy, for I&rsquo;ve half a dozen
professional calls slated between now and dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">289</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks awfully. Will you tell Petra I&rsquo;m coming?
I&rsquo;d rather not talk to her now. Tell her everything&rsquo;s all
right; I&rsquo;ll explain everything when I get there and she
mustn&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this casual request Lewis made a sound that
McCloud accepted as both promise and good-by&mdash;and
hung up. He had not even asked was Petra there. But
Meadowbrook? McCloud must be calling from Green
Doors itself. Had he been there all day? Had it been
more than a sick tire that ailed his car? Well, Lewis did
not care about the details&mdash;just so long as Petra and
Neil did not see each other again until Lewis himself
could talk with Petra on the edge of the meadow to-night.</p>
<p>He went through into his own office where the tragic
trio awaited him. He took the boy from the mother&rsquo;s
arms. The poor little creature came quietly, without the
struggle the parents obviously expected, and from that
moment, so kind are the ways of God with mortals
when they have learned to pray, Lewis&rsquo; expectation
of Neil&rsquo;s near visit and even his anguish for and over
Petra were dropped from his consciousness until the work
in hand was over&mdash;until, in fact, he escorted the parents,
himself still holding the boy, out to the elevator, and
saw Neil sitting in the reception office in a patient attitude
that bore the stamp of having lasted some time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; Lewis remarked, coming back. &ldquo;The coast is
clear now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neil followed him into his office and took the patients&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_290">290</span>
chair. But memory assailed him in the act and
he went a little pale. The feeling passed quickly, however.
That page had been turned forever, he knew well.
His cure was permanent. Heaven would not take back
its boon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Petra?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I suppose you packed
her off to Meadowbrook early. I&rsquo;m glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did exactly that. You didn&rsquo;t pass her on the
road?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I wasn&rsquo;t expecting to, you see. I drove like
blazes. But I&rsquo;m going right back. Pretty plucky of Petra,
don&rsquo;t you think, to come right along to work this morning!
I couldn&rsquo;t. I couldn&rsquo;t have gone to work this morning
if not going would bring the end of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Petra&rsquo;s not working on commission. We have
to keep hours here,&rdquo; Lewis remarked shortly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
your own boss. That&rsquo;s different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis could not interpret the odd, quick look Neil
gave him then. But that did not matter. What right had
the man to sit there so victorious and exalted, speaking
of Petra! Petra&rsquo;s face had grown thin over night. There
had been no exaltation and glow on its pallor this day.
But Lewis was aware that Neil&rsquo;s exaltation&mdash;if that was
the word for the light in his face&mdash;was of a grave
variety. Not blatant. It was refined of all dross, to the
most casual eye. Gorgeousness had given place to something
deeper, richer.... Lewis felt his own expression
of countenance to be evil. It was as if he could feel a
thin mask forming over his face,&mdash;particularly ugly
<span class="pb" id="Page_291">291</span>
around his mouth and eyes. He looked at Miss Frazier&rsquo;s
door knob. He dared not look at McCloud any more.
But hate had not returned. Only the awful fear that it
might return was stiffening his lips,&mdash;his eyelids. For
if it did return, here while he faced McCloud, it would
be hate of the killing sort. He would hurl himself at the
man physically, destroy him if he could&mdash;or be destroyed....
He had better smoke. They had better
both smoke.</p>
<p>Neil refused the cigarette. Well, the gods on Olympus
didn&rsquo;t smoke little white cigarettes. But Lewis had no
nectar to proffer this young giant, face and body aglow
with some sweet, secret victory, eyes sea-blue and steady,
long-limbed, free-postured, at ease in the patients&rsquo; chair.
What right had such a being to usurp the place where
misery came, year in year out? <i>Why in God&rsquo;s name was
Neil here?</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Petra told you anything about last night?&rdquo; Neil
asked. &ldquo;I guess she hasn&rsquo;t, or you wouldn&rsquo;t have spoken
about her having to keep hours as you did just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis shook his head. Then he trusted his voice.
&ldquo;No. I know nothing. Except that the child ran away
from her birthday party last night,&mdash;said she was going
to bed with a headache but ran out the front door instead,
without a wrap, and got back at eight this morning,
still in her party dress and fagged almost to the
danger point. But she&rsquo;s going to tell me. She wants to,
I think. I am going out there to-night. Petra has let me
assume a responsibility to her. And I might as well tell
<span class="pb" id="Page_292">292</span>
you, McCloud, that she is as precious to me&mdash;and her
welfare as precious&mdash;as if she were my own flesh and
blood. You&rsquo;d better understand that. Now what are you
here for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s wonderful!&rdquo; was the man&rsquo;s surprising answer.
&ldquo;But I rather felt that all along, you know. What I
can&rsquo;t understand is Petra&rsquo;s not feeling it, not trusting you
before. But this is a grand time for her to begin. She
may never need you again so much as she needs you right
now, Doctor. She&rsquo;s going to need steadying&mdash;and a
lot of loving. I&rsquo;m frightened for her, myself. She&rsquo;s such
a kid, really, in spite of the way she swells around with
her <i>three</i> jobs and keeps a stiff upper lip. You&rsquo;d think
she was made of iron! But she isn&rsquo;t. She&rsquo;s really just
a tender-hearted, frightened kid. Teresa, you see, is
mother, brother, sister, parents to her, as well as friend.
Teresa is home to Petra. All the home she&rsquo;s ever known.
Sanctuary too. If&mdash;if anything happens&mdash;to&mdash;to
Teresa&mdash;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if Petra goes right off her
head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Where was the exaltation now? This was just a boy,
fighting back sobs.</p>
<p>Lewis got up. He went to the window and sat on the
sill, staring at McCloud. But McCloud got control of
himself quickly&mdash;and with it the exalted look returned.
His eyes were blue fire and so terribly steady.</p>
<p>Lewis said, &ldquo;Neil, I don&rsquo;t know a thing. Petra has
been secret with me. From the beginning&mdash;or almost
from the beginning. I thought you and she were together
<span class="pb" id="Page_293">293</span>
last night. I&rsquo;ve got it all wrong. What was it
really? Something to do with Teresa Kerr?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neil got up then. He came and sat on Lewis&rsquo; desk, his
feet in Lewis&rsquo; chair. He hadn&rsquo;t taken in what Lewis
meant about himself and Petra&mdash;at least not its implication.
It simply passed him by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We <i>were</i> together,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was there. Teresa
was terribly ill. It must have been about ten o&rsquo;clock
when it started. Janet got the doctor and Father Morris
on the telephone. But I&rsquo;m worried about that doctor.
I don&rsquo;t like him or trust him much. Clark&rsquo;s his name.
He has a general practice in Meadowbrook. He knows
all about you, of course, but says you won&rsquo;t know him.
I told him I was coming to ask you to see Teresa and
advise us. <i>He</i> says Teresa&rsquo;s got to go right off to a sanitarium.
There&rsquo;s one in New Mexico that he says is her
only chance. He says she ought to start to-morrow. But
I don&rsquo;t take any stock in him. Neither does Janet Frazier.
She says you are the one who will know what we ought
to do. Janet is sure&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Lewis interrupted: &ldquo;Neil McCloud! Start over,
will you. I can&rsquo;t seem to catch on to what all this is
about. You were at Teresa Kerr&rsquo;s last night? How does
Miss Frazier come into it? Where does Teresa live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little house between Meadowbrook and Green
Doors. Off the road. You&rsquo;ve never seen it, probably.
Nobody does. It&rsquo;s right off the road&mdash;in another world.
The girls call it Mary&rsquo;s Field. Teresa&rsquo;s got a touch of
consumption. That&rsquo;s why she&rsquo;s there this summer. So
<span class="pb" id="Page_294">294</span>
that she can live practically out of doors. On the porch.
She was there, in the long chair, last night. Janet and
I had got supper together. Janet&rsquo;s spending her vacation
there. We were talking, very gay. It was moonlight.
Janet has a mandolin. She&rsquo;s good on it, too. Finally, quite
late, Janet went in to do the dishes. She wouldn&rsquo;t let
me come. So I stayed out with Teresa. I was going in a
few minutes, anyway. Getting back to Boston. I was sitting
there on the floor by Teresa&rsquo;s chair. She was lying
in the long chair&mdash;almost flat. That&rsquo;s what she&rsquo;s had
to do lately&mdash;whenever she&rsquo;s not sewing. She&rsquo;s so terribly
tired all the time! We weren&rsquo;t talking any more. I
thought she&rsquo;d better rest. I was trying to make myself
go home. Suddenly she sat up straight with a queer sound
in her throat. I jumped up. She put out her hands. Blood
came from her mouth. It was only moonlight but I
knew it was blood. I thought&mdash;we both thought&mdash;she
was dying. We said things we&rsquo;d never have said if we
hadn&rsquo;t thought so. But that&rsquo;s all right. God intended it,
I guess. I called Janet. She got Doctor Clark on the telephone&mdash;and
then Father Morris. Father Morris is
pastor of St. Joseph&rsquo;s in Meadowbrook. It&rsquo;s been Teresa&rsquo;s
church all summer. Father Morris seemed to know
more than the doctor what to do for Teresa. The doctor
just stood around and scolded us about Teresa&rsquo;s having
worked so hard on Petra&rsquo;s birthday dress. A good thing
Petra wasn&rsquo;t there then! It was Father Morris who told
us Teresa wasn&rsquo;t dying. He and Petra, when Petra
came, had the coolest heads of us all. They managed
<span class="pb" id="Page_295">295</span>
everything. Petra and I stayed with Teresa on the
porch all night. She couldn&rsquo;t sleep and Father Morris
advised against any drug. We just stayed there quiet.
Close to her. At dawn she went to sleep and Janet made
us eat breakfast. I took Petra back to Green Doors. We
thought Teresa was all right then, you see. But early
this afternoon, Doctor Pryne, she had another hemorrhage.
That&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t call Petra as I promised to.
I didn&rsquo;t want her to know until she got to Mary&rsquo;s Field
this afternoon and could see how really better Teresa
seems, in spite of this second hemorrhage. She&rsquo;s seemed
so well all day&mdash;even strong! She even wanted to sit
up, but we haven&rsquo;t let her. Father Morris came to the
house just before I did call you and said I&rsquo;d better not
wait for Petra&rsquo;s consent to our asking you to see Teresa.
He urged me to drive right in and bring you both out.
He says Teresa is very seriously ill, now, in spite of her
feeling so well, and he feels that we must do something
as quickly as possible. He knows about you and your
work and was sure you&rsquo;d come for Petra&rsquo;s sake. You
will, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Neil had told it all quickly, his eyes
never leaving Lewis&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Neil. You don&rsquo;t need to ask! But tell me
more. Is this why money is so important to Petra? Had
she been supporting Teresa with the allowance I was
the cause of her losing? Of course. How blind I&rsquo;ve
been!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teresa makes Petra&rsquo;s clothes and Petra pays her for
that. Teresa&rsquo;s got the devil&rsquo;s own pride. She insists on
<span class="pb" id="Page_296">296</span>
earning her money, even when she can&rsquo;t hold up her
head. So you can&rsquo;t say Petra&rsquo;s been exactly supporting
Teresa. She went to Radcliffe, you know, on a scholarship
and evenings making Petra&rsquo;s clothes. The idea was
that when Teresa got her degree and a job&mdash;perhaps
one like Janet&rsquo;s&mdash;Petra would kiss Clare good-by and
live with Teresa and go to some business college herself.
They had it all worked out. Teresa was so quick
and worked so hard, she hoped to graduate in less than
four years. Petra&rsquo;s &lsquo;job&rsquo; at Green Doors was to be merely
temporary. That is how she has been able to stand it.
But last spring, when everything was working out beautifully,
the college doctor found that Teresa had T.B.
and they wouldn&rsquo;t let her take her exams. They said she
must live in the country, out of doors, all this summer.
Petra found the house. She furnished it&mdash;borrowed
ahead on her allowance. The place belongs to a farmer
named Murray and it&rsquo;s always been called &lsquo;Murray&rsquo;s
Field.&rsquo; But Teresa understood it &lsquo;Mary&rsquo;s Field&rsquo; and took
it without seeing it on account of the name! It&rsquo;s been
easy to keep Teresa&rsquo;s living there secret from Green
Doors&mdash;it&rsquo;s so out of the way. But that&rsquo;s where Petra
has been wrong. Teresa would think so too, if she knew.
It&rsquo;s like living a double life. All Petra&rsquo;s excuses for being
away from Green Doors, you know! Teresa has never
guessed how Petra&rsquo;s had to twist and turn. She&rsquo;d never
have let her! Teresa&rsquo;s like truth itself. But sometimes I
have to laugh when I picture how astonished Clare would
be if she could see Petra Saturday afternoons, on her
<span class="pb" id="Page_297">297</span>
hands and knees, scrubbing the kitchen floor at Mary&rsquo;s
Field&mdash;until I came along, that is. I do the kitchen
floor now on Saturdays!&mdash;Both the girls are death on
dirt. But lately Teresa hasn&rsquo;t been able even to wash
the dishes and Petra&rsquo;s done all the cleaning ever since
they took the house.&mdash;What&rsquo;s the matter, Pryne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you trust me? Why did you all leave me
out so long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did trust you. We do. Absolutely. Janet and I,
at least. But Petra&rsquo;s been so afraid all the time! Afraid
you wouldn&rsquo;t keep it from Clare. She says you belong
to Green Doors&mdash;not Mary&rsquo;s Field. Petra&rsquo;s a grand
kid but she&rsquo;s stubborn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;let&rsquo;s get going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Mary&rsquo;s Field?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where else? Petra&rsquo;s bound to be there, I should
think. And I&rsquo;d better see Teresa for myself before taking
a specialist to her. You shut the windows, Neil, while
I just write up this card for the files. I&rsquo;ll have to cut
out the calls I was making, for Father Morris may be
right, that quick action is needed. Meadowbrook may
not be the place for Teresa to stay,&mdash;but I hardly think
we&rsquo;ll send her so far as New Mexico&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the while Lewis talked, he was outlining his recent
interview with the idiot boy&rsquo;s parents in illegible
characters on a fresh white card. His heart was shaken
to its depths but his head and hand were steady.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_298">298</div>
<h2 id="c24"><i>Chapter Twenty-Four</i></h2><div class="img"><img src="images/ch.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="30" /></div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the next turn to the right now. Go slow or
you&rsquo;ll miss it. It looks like a cart road&mdash;a wood
road.... Here &rsquo;tis. Yes, it&rsquo;s all right. My car&rsquo;s gone
over it hundreds of times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the roughest sort of track, cut through a beech
wood, up a hill. They had driven out in Lewis&rsquo; car,
leaving Neil&rsquo;s parked in Marlboro Street. A quarter of
a mile of rough going, a turn, and suddenly Lewis saw
the farmhouse through lacings of bare branches straight
ahead. It was set halfway up a sloping meadow with an
orchard at its back. The little old clapboarded dwelling
was the color of the branches through which Lewis was
seeing it, silver-gray-black-violet. In some lights, particularly
after summer rains, the clapboards would be
opal.</p>
<p>Neil suggested that they leave the car at the bottom
of the meadow and walk up. &ldquo;Teresa may be sleeping.
She won&rsquo;t be expecting to hear a car at this time of
day, anyway, and it might startle her. The milkman
brings the groceries along with his milk once a day and
<span class="pb" id="Page_299">299</span>
that&rsquo;s the only car except mine that ever comes. We
didn&rsquo;t tell her I was bringing you. We didn&rsquo;t know you
could get away. We thought we&rsquo;d wait to explain&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doorstep, a flat stone, had beguiled the doorsill
to follow its own smooth sunken curve. The door stood
open into a passage which appeared nothing but transition
to clearer, finer country, for it was open at its farther
end onto long rows of crooked old bare apple trees twisted
by many years of bearing into mysterious contours of
beauty. And through the orchard one saw the rounded,
mellow slope of the hilltop, outlining a horizon.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">There is an orchard, old and rare,&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">I cannot tell you where,&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">With green doors opening to the sun.</p>
</div>
<p>Green doors! This was the green doors that Clare
had hoped to hymn&mdash;and missed the note. &ldquo;<i>I cannot
tell you where!</i>&rdquo; Cannot because there is no telling it.
In this moment of remembering the lines which had
given Clare her inspiration for Green Doors, and which
she often quoted, Lewis&rsquo; antipathy for Clare was transmuted
into unalloyed pity. Clare wanted the beautiful
and good in her life. Sincerely wanted it. But she thought
it was necessary to spin it out of herself somehow,&mdash;industriously,
cleverly spin, spin, spin. It never occurred
to her to search for the Beautiful Good, or to love It for
Itself in Its objective reality. She was too busy, all times,
manufacturing its semblance out of fancy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_300">300</div>
<p>Yes. As Lewis stepped over the sill into the little
old passage to the crooked, beautiful orchard, a kaleidoscope
shift took place in his sympathy. And at the same
moment the experience of the early morning was upon
him again; <i>he had been through all this before. He knew
this passage, that orchard, by heart.</i> He knew, too, that
grief (he had been wrong in this much of the morning&rsquo;s
prevision: it was grief but never tragedy) was waiting
him here at the real Green Doors.</p>
<p>Miss Frazier came through a door halfway down the
passage and met them. She said in a lowered voice,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come! Everything will be all right now. I knew
you&rsquo;d come. Go into the living room, please, and I&rsquo;ll
explain to Teresa. Or Neil, you come with me. You will
be better than I. We haven&rsquo;t told her Neil was bringing
you, you see, Doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Petra?&rdquo; Lewis asked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She took a rug and her coat and went up into the
orchard to sleep. She took your sedative first. But she
wants to know when you come. I promised. She wouldn&rsquo;t
have rested unless. She doesn&rsquo;t know about the second
hemorrhage, or what Father Morris has said. She thinks
Teresa is better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis went into the living room. And even before
his eyes began assembling details, he knew, with a start,
that everything was here that he had looked to find
this morning in Petra&rsquo;s bedroom at Green Doors. This
was her environment, her sanctuary, her own place in
the sun. He felt Petra&rsquo;s heart beating in this little room,
<span class="pb" id="Page_301">301</span>
no matter if they said she was up in the orchard, sleeping.
The wide old boards of the floor slanted and dipped as
the doorsill had slanted and dipped&mdash;fluid&mdash;one with
the flow of life and time. And there, across the room,
between two low-silled windows was the birthday present,
his own Fra Angelico picture&mdash;perfectly hung. So
Petra had brought it here, not to Green Doors. But of
course. And under the Fra Angelico there were flowers
growing in a dish. Fringed, blue gentians. A big, living
clump of them. Planted in dark earth. It is impossible
to gather them without the roots, Lewis knew, hence
the replanting. On the table, beside the gentians, lay a
book, open and face down.</p>
<p>Lewis, with an instinct to save any book, no matter
what it was, from abuse, crossed the floor; he would
find a marker and close the volume kindly. But when
he had it in his hand, it defended its owner with dumb
sweetness. It was a Modern Library publication, made
for easy usage; the only value it set on itself the value
of its word,&mdash;spirit not flesh. Lewis glanced at the
title: &ldquo;Marius the Epicurean.&rdquo; Memory stirred. This
was the book&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;Petra had claimed to have
been reading when she did not come to play tennis with
Clare that day Lewis first went to Green Doors! The
identical volume. He was sure of it. So Clare had been
wrong&mdash;as, poor creature, she was ever in peril of
being: Petra had been reading &ldquo;Marius&rdquo; that afternoon.
She had been lying out there in the orchard, near the
horizon, side by side with Teresa. They had lain supported
<span class="pb" id="Page_302">302</span>
by their elbows, turn and turn about, reading
&ldquo;Marius&rdquo; together. Lewis knew all about that afternoon
now, as well as if he had been here himself, in the
golden orchard with green doors opening to the sun,
sharing &ldquo;Marius&rdquo; with them!</p>
<p>And he was glad to know! Then, that June Saturday,
he had told himself it was nothing if Petra wanted to
impress Clare with reading she had never done. It didn&rsquo;t
matter. It was a trivial schoolgirl variety of deception.
But now he knew that it had mattered. He had cared
more than a little, deep down in his heart. It had left
a mark, a tiny wound, but still tender enough to feel the
healing in this moment of discovery.</p>
<p>A paper fluttered from &ldquo;Marius,&rdquo; held open and face
down in Lewis&rsquo; hand. He rescued it from the floor and
stood staring. It was his own picture, cut from the rotogravure
section of the <i>New York Times</i>,&mdash;a photograph
of the head that young Italian artist, Ponini, had made
when Lewis was in New York last spring, testifying in
the Spalding murder case. Ponini had been one of the
State&rsquo;s witnesses. He had introduced himself to Lewis
outside the courtroom and persuaded him to sit for him
a few times during that tedious week of the trial. Ponini
had won surprising acclaim for this particular work, and
photographs of the head had been published endlessly,
till Lewis was sick of opening magazine or paper and
seeing it. But Petra! She had chanced on it, cut it out
and preserved it. She must have done this before that
Saturday when they met again at Green Doors. This
<span class="pb" id="Page_303">303</span>
was Petra&rsquo;s writing, in the narrow white margin. She
had written &ldquo;Marius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this was carrying things beyond strangeness&mdash;into
truth itself, which cannot be strange or startling! Years
ago, in college, Lewis had identified himself with
Marius. A peculiarly poignant identification it had been.&mdash;Marius,
born on the fringes of Christianity but never
amalgamated into it. Always wistful, speculative, skeptical.
Infinitely skeptical&mdash;but passionately searching.
Drawn poignantly toward Christians whenever they
came into his life. Loving them beyond others with a
sure, contented love. Dying finally to save one of them
from death. Ministered to in the act of dying by Christians
who took it for granted that the martyr to friendship
was one of themselves. Marius hungering for Christianity
but never attaining communion with it until the
instant of his death&mdash;and then attaining it by affinity
and accident rather than conviction! But how had Petra
seen Lewis in all this? How had Petra known!</p>
<p>Lewis replaced the marker in the book, and the book
face down, open at the place he had found it, beside
the gentians. Thin October late afternoon sunlight
slanted through the little, low-ceiled room, casting a
transparency over the white, old paneled walls and the
wine-colored floorboards. It was a blest light. There
was a blessing on this place. And the blessing, for Lewis,
suddenly seemed flowing in one direction and coming
to form and color in the clump of blue gentians under
the Fra Angelico.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_304">304</div>
<h2 id="c25"><i>Chapter Twenty-Five</i></h2><div class="img"><img src="images/ch.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="30" /></div>
<p>Teresa&rsquo;s bed was on the porch off the dining room.
Miss Frazier took Lewis as far as the door and left
him to go out alone. But Neil was there, sitting on the
foot of Teresa&rsquo;s bed. There was room for no more than
Teresa&rsquo;s narrow cot, her long chair, a table and one
other little wicker chair. Yet Lewis, who had a penchant
for spaciousness, had no sense of crowding here. On the
contrary, he felt that coming onto Teresa&rsquo;s little porch
was like coming out onto deck at sea. The disused farmlands
rolled wavelike away on every side, with no glimpse
of dwelling or human being anywhere; all was soft,
long sweep of meadow and field, climbing waves of
woodland, and over all the flowing sky. Teresa&rsquo;s cot
stood against the outer edge of the porch, protected
above by deep eaves. Over its head, a dark crucifix,
tarnished silver, and about a foot high, was nailed
against a supporting post.</p>
<p>Not a breath of change seemed to have passed over
Teresa since that October day four years ago, when she
had opened the door for Lewis in the Farwells&rsquo; Cambridge
<span class="pb" id="Page_305">305</span>
apartment. She was fresh and vivid, with smiles
rippling to light in brown-gold eyes, and an unselfish,
lovely mouth, molded by gaiety and humor. And her
voice, exactly as Lewis had remembered it through the
years, bore out the smile in her eyes. Yes, Teresa was
still all of one piece&mdash;spirit and body one. Lewis saw
an almost palpable bloom upon her&mdash;not the bloom of
health, since she was emaciated and flushed with fever&mdash;but
a bloom, all the same, of freshness and well-being.</p>
<p>Neil pushed the wicker chair a few inches nearer the
side of the bed for Lewis&rsquo; benefit. Lewis, taking the
chair, was moved by the effect the dark crucifix, bathed
in afternoon light from New England earth and sky,
produced on his mood. For, out of doors like this, superimposed
against New England fields and sky, the crucifix
threw new proportions, as it were, athwart Lewis&rsquo; concepts.
It produced space for infinities and eternities
of joyful well-being. Without analyzing it&mdash;indeed
scarcely noting it&mdash;Lewis accepted the shifting of proportions,
the touch of sweetness his passing glance at
the cross had brought, with simple gratitude: an unuttered
thank-you to the Savior.</p>
<p>Neil was saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be within call, Doctor, if you
want anything.&rdquo; As Neil spoke, he came around past
Lewis&rsquo; shoulder and adjusted Teresa&rsquo;s pillow, his arm
for an instant back of it, under her shoulders. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that
better? Is it all right, Teresa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The look that passed between the boy and the girl
then was one that Lewis charged his heart to remember.
<span class="pb" id="Page_306">306</span>
It was love, of course. And love between a man and
a woman. Complete recognition of all that such love
implies. Yet, although this recognition was no new thing
with them, they had kissed each other only when both
thought Teresa was dying, and in farewell. And beyond
this, not even in farewell&mdash;since they were forewarned,
having &ldquo;fallen&rdquo; once&mdash;their lips would never touch
again this side of Paradise. Lewis knew. If Neil had not
confided in him on the drive here, by silences and broken
words, Lewis would still have seen the definiteness of
their renunciation in the light of the smiling glance that
had passed between them as Neil adjusted the pillow,
and known that their love held no flaw of possible betrayal
in it. These two were at peace with their Faith
and everything of both agony and joy that it entailed
for them. But this was not renunciation as religionless
moralists think of it. It was simplicity, the simplicity of
spiritual health.</p>
<p>When Neil had gone, leaving Lewis and the sick girl
alone, Lewis was suddenly shy of Teresa. It was she
who should measure his health, not he hers. For it is
not the whole but the sick who need a physician. Yet
he took Teresa&rsquo;s wrist, lying there on her counterpane,
and started counting her pulse.</p>
<p>Then Teresa laughed&mdash;putting him off, making him
lose the count. &ldquo;I thought you never made an examination
without Janet to take down notes,&rdquo; she protested.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s here, quite handy. Sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t we call her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks. This is an exception. I&rsquo;ll remember well
<span class="pb" id="Page_307">307</span>
enough.&rdquo; And indeed he would. Every word that Teresa
gave him, as he asked it, of family history, the course
of the development of her disease and the treatment it
had had, was etched on his mind for all of life, he felt.
He needed no filing card for Teresa. But neither had
he needed her answers to his short, quick questions. When
he came to it, the examination he gave her lungs told
him that she was doomed.</p>
<p>After that examination he sat back, trying to smile
at Teresa, trying to be natural. Wasn&rsquo;t there something
simple and of ordinary day that he could say? But he
was shy of this girl as he had never been shy of any
one in all this mortal world before. Shy but not ill at
ease. It was good to be here, he felt. Simply that.</p>
<p>Teresa was smiling into his attempted smile. &ldquo;Are
you really all done?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so. The specialists will be more thorough, of
course. But I know what to do now, what man we want
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will tell me what you think yourself, Doctor?
How ill I am?&rdquo; She put her hand under her pillow
as she asked the brave question and kept it there. Lewis
knew that she had found her rosary and was holding
it. &ldquo;They say&mdash;Neil and Doctor Clark&mdash;even Petra&mdash;that
I must go away to a sanitarium somewhere.
Leave Mary&rsquo;s Field. But that won&rsquo;t happen, will it? I
can stay here. I needn&rsquo;t leave Mary&rsquo;s Field. Is that what
you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis had no lies for Teresa. He would not lie to
<span class="pb" id="Page_308">308</span>
her by so much as a glance. She was fit for the truth.
Perfectly fit. Had he ever been face to face with any
one else so stripped, fit and ready for truth!</p>
<p>&ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be any question about that now. I&rsquo;m
sure of so much,&rdquo; Lewis said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep you right
here at Mary&rsquo;s Field. And Petra will stay with you all
the time. Move her things here. Make it her home. And
Neil will be near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was smiling. Her hand stayed under her pillow.
But tears came to her eyes. Only two escaped, though:
one down either cheek. She ignored them but Lewis
wiped them away with his own handkerchief. &ldquo;My
blessed child,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You wanted to know. It is
right that you should, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;And I knew that you
would tell me. I am&mdash;very satisfied. It will be nice,
not leaving Mary&rsquo;s Field. Having Petra here all the
time. Having Neil near. Will you tell them how things
are with me? You won&rsquo;t leave it for me to tell them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Soon, I&rsquo;ll tell them. But not to-night, I think.
They aren&rsquo;t like you, Teresa. It will go harder with
them. They will need time&mdash;and your prayers. You
must pray that they may be brave. Neil suspects already,
I can tell you. But he still hopes. Petra has only a
bewildered, vague fear. So Neil says, anyway. They
needn&rsquo;t be told yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when the time comes, it will be you&mdash;not Neil,
nor Janet&mdash;nobody else but you, Doctor Pryne,&mdash;who
<span class="pb" id="Page_309">309</span>
tells Petra? Unless it&rsquo;s me. I may want to be the one to
tell her in the end. But otherwise you? And you&rsquo;ll take
care of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say this? Petra is the dearest thing in
life to me, Teresa. But I don&rsquo;t know that that will help
her. She doesn&rsquo;t let me very close to her. Neil or Janet
might be better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please tell her now, this afternoon, that she&rsquo;s the
dearest thing in life to you. She doesn&rsquo;t dream it. She&rsquo;s
so silly and humble. She&rsquo;s sweet. She told me, just a
little while ago, before she took your pills like a good
child and went away to sleep in the meadow, that Dick
had showed you that letter she wrote to him at
Mount Desert. She&rsquo;s simply dying with humiliation
over it. You see, it was you, Doctor, she meant in the
letter, and she has no other thought but that you know
it was. That you might guess wrong hasn&rsquo;t even occurred
to her. You <i>did</i> guess wrong, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis pushed back his chair. Got up. &ldquo;Teresa, bless
you. I wouldn&rsquo;t believe any one but you&mdash;hardly Petra
herself. It&rsquo;s almost impossible to believe. But somehow&mdash;I
can&mdash;I do believe that you know what you are
saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re like Petra, I think. Humble and silly. But
sweet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neil, who for the last ten minutes or so had been
pacing back and forth in the meadow, out of earshot
and where Lewis did not see him, had started for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_310">310</span>
porch the minute Lewis moved back his chair. &ldquo;All
done?&rdquo; he asked, coming up onto the porch and looking
at Lewis for one swift, keen instant. Lewis nodded.
&ldquo;Yes and I want to see Petra. Is she still sleeping?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. Janet kept her promise and woke her when
you came. She&rsquo;s in the kitchen, starting the supper. She
and Janet&mdash;Teresa too&mdash;want you to stay for supper
with us. Petra&rsquo;s getting it started early on purpose, so
you will. Janet&rsquo;s gone across lots for an extra quart of
milk just on the chance. You won&rsquo;t disappoint us, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First let me use the telephone. If McKinstry can
come out this evening, I&rsquo;ll want to wait and see him.
That will make supping here very convenient. Don&rsquo;t talk
to this girl too much now. She should rest, Neil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neil laughed. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t talk at all then. One doesn&rsquo;t,
much, with Teresa. She&rsquo;s the conversationalist of our
Mary&rsquo;s Field crowd. Have you told her to keep quiet,
not talk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis shook his head, smiling down into Teresa&rsquo;s eyes.
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t told her anything. Given no
orders. Teresa is wiser than all of us put together. She&rsquo;s
her own best physician.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in the end, Lewis merely stood thoughtful by the
telephone in the passage for an instant, and turned away,
toward the kitchen. McKinstry, immediately Lewis asked
it, if he could be reached at all by telephone to-day,
would be at Lewis&rsquo; disposal; and if he were out of town
or not on the telephone, there would be some one else
<span class="pb" id="Page_311">311</span>
available who was good, too. But there was no hurry.
Getting a trained nurse out to Mary&rsquo;s Field was of far
more immediate importance than getting a specialist.
Miss Frazier would help Lewis with that, when she
returned with the milk. Lewis himself couldn&rsquo;t remember
the name of that woman who had taken such excellent
care of the little Nolan girl last month. But Miss Frazier,
Janet, would remember. She would remember, too, how
one could reach her. The woman should come to-night,
of course. Sleep here. Or failing her, some one else
whom Janet would recommend. He could wait for Janet
for all that.</p>
<p>Lewis went on down the passage to the kitchen door.
It was the kitchen, supposedly, since Neil had said that
Petra was here, and here she was; but for Lewis it was
no special place at all. It was merely Petra. He had come
to where Petra was, at last. Come up with her. He felt
as if he had been running a long time through dark
eternities to this overtaking of his beloved. Between
Petra and himself there now only remained a little
space of thin, late afternoon light. Blessed light! He
saw her through it as through thin glass&mdash;a pace
away.</p>
<p>She was standing close up against an open window.
Her back to it. She was looking at Lewis through the
glass-thin radiant atmosphere. Then Lewis heard Teresa
say, &ldquo;Janet was careful not to disturb the chessmen, Neil.
The board&rsquo;s on the dining-room table. Shall we finish
the game?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_312">312</div>
<p>Neil said, &ldquo;Sure, in a minute. Let me have a cigarette
first, though, and just stay by you. You lie quiet. Shut
your eyes, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petra was facing Lewis, yes; but she was not seeing
him. She was stone blind with tears. She had been here
in the open window all the time. The porch came within
a few feet of it. It must, since those voices&mdash;Neil&rsquo;s and
Teresa&rsquo;s&mdash;sounded almost as if they were in the very
room. And yet, they were speaking softly. Every bit as
softly as Lewis and Teresa had been speaking. Petra
had heard every word Lewis and Teresa had said, then.
She knew&mdash;she knew&mdash;why, the child knew that
Teresa was going to die. That was as far as Lewis&rsquo;
thought went. Brutally, like that, merely overhearing,
she had learned it. With no warning. Alone, here in
the kitchen,&mdash;with supper to get.</p>
<p>Lewis could not move. Could not speak. He thought
his heart would break for Petra. But though she was
stone blind, she had heard him come into the passage,
hesitate by the telephone, and then his every step to
the kitchen door. And now she whispered, &ldquo;Are you
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that he took the last pace&mdash;in a stride. The long
race was over. She was no longer a flying, mysterious
shadow. Petra was flesh and blood within his arms. But
their first kiss had a taste he had not dreamed for it. It
was salt with both their tears.</p>
<p>As they drew apart, but not their hands&mdash;palm
<span class="pb" id="Page_313">313</span>
against palm they still held each other securely&mdash;Neil&rsquo;s
laugh was ringing in their ears. Quite heartily
Neil was laughing, out there on the porch, sitting on
the foot of Teresa&rsquo;s cot, at something she just had said.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
